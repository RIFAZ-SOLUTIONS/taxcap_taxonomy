The cost of providing such services may be borne initially by the parent, by a specially designated group member ('a group services center' or by another group member. The main issues in the analysis of transfer pricing for intra-group services are: - (a) Whether intra - group services have in fact been provided - (b) Whether the intra-group charge for such services for tax purposes are at arm's length prices. The following factors should serve as a 2ps. guide in determining whether services have been rendered: - (i) Whether the activity provides a respective group member with economic or commercial value to enhance its commercial position and whether an independent enterprise in comparable circumstances would be willing to pay or perform in-house for its services - (ii) If the activity is not one for which the independent would have been willing to pay or perform for itself, the activity ordinarily should 3ps. not be considered as an intra - group services under the arm's length principle - (iii) In general, no intra - group services should be found for activities undertaken by one group member that merely duplicate a service that another group member is performing for itself; or that is being performed for such other group member by a third party - (iv) An associated enterprise should not be considered to receive an intra -group services when it 4ps. obtains incidental attributable solely to its being part of a large concern, and not to any specific activity being performed. 2ps. 1ps.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are the main issues in analyzing transfer pricing for intra-group services?
        answer: |
          The main issues are determining whether intra-group services have actually been provided and whether the intra-group charges for such services are at arm's length prices for tax purposes.
      - question: |
          What factors help determine if intra-group services have been rendered?
        answer: |
          Factors include whether the activity provides economic or commercial value to enhance the group member's commercial position and whether an independent enterprise in comparable circumstances would pay for or perform the service in-house.
      - question: |
          When should an activity not be considered an intra-group service under the arm's length principle?
        answer: |
          An activity should not be considered an intra-group service if an independent enterprise would not have been willing to pay for or perform it, or if the activity merely duplicates a service already performed by another group member or a third party.
      - question: |
          Why might an associated enterprise not be considered to receive an intra-group service?
        answer: |
          An associated enterprise is not considered to receive an intra-group service if it benefits incidentally merely from being part of a larger concern, without any specific activity being performed for it.
      - question: |
          Who can bear the initial cost of providing intra-group services?
        answer: |
          The initial cost of providing intra-group services may be borne by the parent company, a specially designated group member (a 'group services center'), or another group member.

      1ps. 1ps. This is because the net margins which are used in the TNMM are very sensitive to the relative cost structures of the entities being compared, as they include operating efficient distributorship than the independent firm, the application of the TNMM would result in a lower net profit being determined for the distributorship than if the RP method were used. Thus, unless an adjustment could be made to reflect the relative efficiency of the firms 2ps. being compared, use of the TNMM would not provide reliable result. In practice, firms are structurally unique and comparisons of indicators between firms will tend to be less reliable than comparisons made at the gross margin level. For these reasons the TNMM along with the profit split method are considered to be methods of last resort in international practice. This observation does not preclude the TNMM from being used. It must be recognized that reliable information on gross margins 3ps. may be difficult, if not impossible to obtain. Thus information constraints may dictate the TNMM as the only practical approach in many cases. 2ps. 1ps. This observation does not preclude the TNMM from being used. It must be recognized that reliable information on gross margins may be difficult, if not impossible to obtain. Thus information constraints may dictate the TNMM as the only practical approach in many cases. The related party (Tested party) whose profit level will be compared to the profit level of the independent parties will usually be the party 2ps. for which reliable data on the most closely comparable transactions can be identified. It is usually the enterprise that is the least complex and that does not own valuable intangible property. ## Example CCP is a manufacturer of dehydrated food. Its products are distributed to its subsidiaries through Europe.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why are net margins in the Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) considered sensitive?
        answer: |
          Net margins in the TNMM are considered sensitive because they reflect the relative cost structures of the entities being compared, which include operating efficiencies and other structural differences.
      - question: |
          Why is the TNMM considered less reliable than gross margin comparisons?
        answer: |
          The TNMM is considered less reliable than gross margin comparisons because firms are structurally unique, and comparisons of indicators like net profit margins between firms are inherently less accurate.
      - question: |
          Under what circumstances is the TNMM used despite its limitations?
        answer: |
          The TNMM is used when reliable information on gross margins is difficult or impossible to obtain, making it the only practical approach in those cases.
      - question: |
          What characteristics typically define the related party (tested party) selected for TNMM application?
        answer: |
          The tested party is usually the least complex entity, does not own valuable intangible property, and is the one for which reliable and comparable transaction data can be identified.
      - question: |
          Why are the TNMM and profit split method considered methods of last resort in international practice?
        answer: |
          The TNMM and profit split method are considered methods of last resort because they tend to be less reliable due to challenges in comparing net profits and structural differences between firms.
