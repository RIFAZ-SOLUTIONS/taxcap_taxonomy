      1ps. 1ps. Such services may include management, coordination and control functions for the whole group. The cost of providing such services may be borne initially by the parent, by a specially designated group member ('a group services center' or by another group member. The main issues in the analysis of transfer pricing for intra-group services are: - (a) Whether intra - group services have in fact been provided - (b) Whether the intra-group charge for such services for tax purposes are at arm's length prices. The following factors should serve as a 2ps. guide in determining whether services have been rendered: - (i) Whether the activity provides a respective group member with economic or commercial value to enhance its commercial position and whether an independent enterprise in comparable circumstances would be willing to pay or perform in-house for its services - (ii) If the activity is not one for which the independent would have been willing to pay or perform for itself, the activity ordinarily should 3ps. not be considered as an intra - group services under the arm's length principle - (iii) In general, no intra - group services should be found for activities undertaken by one group member that merely duplicate a service that another group member is performing for itself; or that is being performed for such other group member by a third party - (iv) An associated enterprise should not be considered to receive an intra -group services when it 4ps. obtains incidental attributable solely to its being part of a large concern, and not to any specific activity being performed. 2ps. 1ps. The cost of providing such services may be borne initially by the parent, by a specially designated group member ('a group services center' or by another group member.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are the primary issues in analyzing transfer pricing for intra-group services?
        answer: |
          The main issues are whether intra-group services have actually been provided and whether the intra-group charges for such services are at arm's length prices for tax purposes.
      - question: |
          What factors help determine whether intra-group services have been rendered?
        answer: |
          The factors include whether the activity provides economic or commercial value to enhance the group's position and whether it is something an independent enterprise would be willing to pay for or perform in-house under comparable circumstances.
      - question: |
          Why might an activity not be considered an intra-group service under the arm's length principle?
        answer: |
          If an independent enterprise would not be willing to pay for or perform the activity for itself, the activity usually should not be treated as an intra-group service under the arm's length principle.
      - question: |
          When are activities considered not to qualify as an intra-group service?
        answer: |
          Activities do not qualify as intra-group services if they merely duplicate a service already being performed by another group member or by a third party for another group member, or if the benefits are incidental and attributable solely to being part of a large concern.
      - question: |
          Who can initially bear the cost of providing intra-group services?
        answer: |
          The cost can initially be borne by the parent company, a specially designated group member ('a group services center'), or another group member.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the Tanzania Revenue Authority's Transfer Pricing Guidelines?
        answer: |
          The Transfer Pricing Guidelines are designed as a practical guide rather than an exhaustive discussion, intended to help address transfer pricing issues while considering taxpayers' business strategies and commercial judgment.
      - question: |
          How are cases under the Transfer Pricing Guidelines decided?
        answer: |
          Each transfer pricing arrangement case is evaluated on its specific factors and circumstances, taking into account the business strategies and commercial judgment of the taxpayers involved.
      - question: |
          Are the Transfer Pricing Guidelines static or subject to change?
        answer: |
          The Guidelines are periodically reviewed and revised on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain applicable and up-to-date.
      - question: |
          What is mentioned in the contents under '9.0 Factors Determining Comparability'?
        answer: |
          The section titled '9.0 Factors Determining Comparability' appears on page 10 and discusses factors used to establish comparability between transactions for transfer pricing purposes.
      - question: |
          What does 'The Arm's Length Principle' section in the Guidelines focus on?
        answer: |
          The 'Arm's Length Principle' section, located on page 4, delves into the principle that prices set between related entities should reflect those that would be agreed upon by independent parties in similar conditions.
  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. This is because the net margins which are used in the TNMM are very sensitive to the relative cost structures of the entities being compared, as they include operating efficient distributorship than the independent firm, the application of the TNMM would result in a lower net profit being determined for the distributorship than if the RP method were used. Thus, unless an adjustment could be made to reflect the relative efficiency of the firms 2ps. being compared, use of the TNMM would not provide reliable result. In practice, firms are structurally unique and comparisons of indicators between firms will tend to be less reliable than comparisons made at the gross margin level. For these reasons the TNMM along with the profit split method are considered to be methods of last resort in international practice. This observation does not preclude the TNMM from being used. It must be recognized that reliable information on gross margins 3ps. may be difficult, if not impossible to obtain. Thus information constraints may dictate the TNMM as the only practical approach in many cases. 2ps. 1ps. This observation does not preclude the TNMM from being used. It must be recognized that reliable information on gross margins may be difficult, if not impossible to obtain. Thus information constraints may dictate the TNMM as the only practical approach in many cases. The related party (Tested party) whose profit level will be compared to the profit level of the independent parties will usually be the party 2ps. for which reliable data on the most closely comparable transactions can be identified. It is usually the enterprise that is the least complex and that does not own valuable intangible property. ## Example CCP is a manufacturer of dehydrated food. Its products are distributed to its subsidiaries through Europe.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the main disadvantage of using the Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM)?
        answer: |
          The main disadvantage of using the TNMM is that its net margins are highly sensitive to the relative cost structures of the entities being compared, which can result in less reliable comparisons unless appropriate adjustments are made.
      - question: |
          Why are firms considered structurally unique in the context of TNMM analysis?
        answer: |
          Firms are considered structurally unique because they typically have differences in cost structures and operating efficiency, making their net margin comparisons less reliable compared to gross margin level comparisons.
      - question: |
          Why is the TNMM considered a method of last resort in international practice?
        answer: |
          The TNMM is considered a method of last resort because reliable gross margin information is often difficult or impossible to obtain, and comparisons at the net margin level are less reliable due to structural differences between firms.
      - question: |
          When might the TNMM be the only practical approach despite its limitations?
        answer: |
          The TNMM might be the only practical approach in cases where reliable information on gross margins is unavailable, making it necessary to rely on net margin data even if it is less reliable.
      - question: |
          What type of related party is typically used as the tested party in TNMM analysis?
        answer: |
          The related party used as the tested party is usually the least complex enterprise that does not own valuable intangible property and for which reliable data on closely comparable transactions can be identified.
