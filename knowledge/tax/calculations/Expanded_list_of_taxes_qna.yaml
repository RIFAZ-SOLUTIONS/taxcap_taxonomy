    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How is the export duty calculated for goods?
        answer: |
          The export duty is calculated using the formula: Export Duty = FOB Value × Rate. For example, for raw hides and skins valued at TZS 1,000,000 with a duty rate of 80%, the export duty is 1,000,000 × 0.80 = 800,000 TZS.
      - question: |
          What is the formula used to calculate stamp duty?
        answer: |
          The formula for stamp duty is: Tax = Sum of taxes for each bracket. Different portions of income are taxed at varying rates, which are then summed to determine the total stamp duty.
      - question: |
          How is the total stamp duty computed for a monthly salary of TZS 1,000,000?
        answer: |
          The total stamp duty is computed by applying progressive tax rates to income brackets: 0% on TZS 170,000; 9% on the next TZS 130,000; 20% on the next TZS 120,000; and 30% on the remaining TZS 580,000. The total is 0 + 11,700 + 24,000 + 174,000 = 209,700 TZS.
      - question: |
          What is the formula for calculating property tax, and how is it applied to a property valued at TZS 50,000,000?
        answer: |
          The property tax formula is: Property Tax = Property Value × Rate. For a property valued at TZS 50,000,000 with a rate of 0.15%, the property tax is 50,000,000 × 0.0015 = 75,000 TZS.
      - question: |
          How is the service levy determined, and what would it be for a turnover of TZS 100,000,000?
        answer: |
          The service levy is determined using the formula: Service Levy = Turnover × 0.003. For a turnover of TZS 100,000,000, the service levy is 100,000,000 × 0.003 = 300,000 TZS.
