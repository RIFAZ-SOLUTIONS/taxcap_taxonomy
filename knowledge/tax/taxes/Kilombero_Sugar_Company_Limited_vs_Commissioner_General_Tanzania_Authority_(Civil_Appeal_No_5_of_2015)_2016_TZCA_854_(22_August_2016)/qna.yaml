  - context: |
      Court of Appeal Rules, 2009. Third, Mr. 3ps. Mtafya submitted that a decree issued under Rule 23(2) is only for the purpose of execution and not for an appeal. With respect, this cannot find favour with us. 4ps. 1ps. More precisely, in Zepharia Letashu v Moruo Ndelamia, Civil Appeal No. 31 of 1998, (CAT, unreported) the Court stated: "A decree is a vital and central part o f the record o f appeal since the appeal is granted on it, hence its absence is fatal to the whole exercise". With respect, this cannot find favour with us. Rule 23(2) does not limit 2ps. the end use of the decree by a party. No doubt, a party can only enforce a valid decree. However, a plain reading of Rule 23(2) shows that it does not bar a party from applying to the Tribunal for the issuance of a valid decree for an appeal or any other purpose. To say that it does, is to stretch the construction of Rule 23(2) beyond 3ps. its breaking point. Fourth, in our considered view, section 32(2) and (3) of the Act cannot save the defective decree, signed only by the Vice-Chairman and not all the members. 5ps. 1ps.

      - question: |
          What does the case of Zepharia Letashu v Moruo Ndelamia highlight about the importance of a decree in an appeal?
        answer: |
          The case highlights that a decree is a vital and central part of the record of appeal since the appeal is granted based on it, and its absence can be fatal to the appeal.

          Why does the Court consider a defective decree signed only by the Vice-Chairman problematic?
        answer: |
          The Court considers it problematic because section 32(2) and (3) of the Act cannot save a defective decree that is not signed by all members.
      - question: |
          What is the Court's stance on interpreting Rule 23(2) in relation to the issuance of decrees?
        answer: |
