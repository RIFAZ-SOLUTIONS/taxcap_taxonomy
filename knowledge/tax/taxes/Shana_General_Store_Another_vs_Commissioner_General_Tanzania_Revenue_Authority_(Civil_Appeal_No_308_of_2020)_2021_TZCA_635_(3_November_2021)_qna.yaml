In so doing, we find it appropriate to start with the second ground of appeal which is a complaint that the Tribunal erred in law by failing to hold that the application for review of the respondent's decision was properly made by the appellant in terms of section 229 (1) of the EACCMA and that since the respondent never determined the application the implication under section 229 (5) 2ps. was that the respondent was not required to impose the import duty complained of. We have stated at the beginning of this judgment that the importer of the goods was SGS. She used the appellant's TIN. The application for review lodged with the respondent appears at p. 113 of the record of appeal. It was written by SGS on headed paper of SGSL. As already stated above, 3ps. it was SGSL who lodged an appeal to the Board against the decision of the respondent imposing import duty on the goods. SGS was joined later. The Tribunal upheld the decision of the Board in holding that SGS and SGSL were different entities. 2ps. 1ps. As already stated above, it was SGSL who lodged an appeal to the Board against the decision of the respondent imposing import duty on the goods. SGS was joined later.

Neither did she lodge an application for review with the respondent. She just joined the proceedings through the amended statement of appeal.
