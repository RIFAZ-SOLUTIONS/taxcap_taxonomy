On this, it was Mr. Nyoni's submission that, after the determination of the respondent's application for enlargement of time to apply for leave to seek prerogative orders, all was done and nothing remained pending before the High Court and as such, the impugned Ruling is not an interlocutory order on the 2ps. basis of what has been defined by the Court in a number of its decisions.
