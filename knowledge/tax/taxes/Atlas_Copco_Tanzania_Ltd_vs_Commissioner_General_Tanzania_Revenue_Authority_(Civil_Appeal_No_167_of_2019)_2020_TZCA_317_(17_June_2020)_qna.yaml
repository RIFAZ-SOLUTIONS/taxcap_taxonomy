      1ps. 1ps. In its decision, the Board held as follows: one, that the appellant did not provide evidence that the commission income was properly reversed as the law required; two, that there was equally no evidence of overstatement of commission income or how the figure was arrived at; and three, that there was no convincing evidence that the alleged reversal was a result of adjustment intended to comply with the 2ps. Atlas Group's transfer pricing policy. On appeal, the Tribunal substantially upheld the Board's decision. It ruled that the alleged errors in the appellant's books were materially doubtful because the appellant ought to have been aware of its group's pricing policy. If it failed to comply with its transfer pricing policy at the 3ps. material time, it could not invoke it retrospectively to effectively reduce its tax liability. Furthermore, the Tribunal was categorical that the appellant's explanations as to what happened after learning that the commissions earned from its sister companies were taxable to VAT were unconvincing. 2ps. 1ps.

Secondly, whether the 3ps. four grounds of appeal raised in the present appeal involve questions of law. As a starting point on what a question of law entails, we wish to acknowledge that it is not the first time that the Court is confronting this subject. 2ps. 1ps.

  ### Document Outline:
  The document discusses the ruling in a tax appeal case between Atlas Copco Tanzania Limited (Appellant) and the Tanzania Revenue Authority (Respondent), centered on a preliminary objection regarding whether the appeal improperly raises matters of fact, contrary to section 25(2) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act. The core issue arose from disputed VAT assessments on commission income, with Atlas Copco contesting the validity of the overstatement and reversal of commission figures, which were rejected by the Revenue Appeals Board and subsequently upheld by the Tribunal.
