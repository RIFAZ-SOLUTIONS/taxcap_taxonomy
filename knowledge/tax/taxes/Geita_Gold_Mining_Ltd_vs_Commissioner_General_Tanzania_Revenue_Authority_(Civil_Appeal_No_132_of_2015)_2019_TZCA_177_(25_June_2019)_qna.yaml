The major condition relevant to the facts of this case is that the remission on the fuel is only valid as long as there is no transfer, sale or disposition of the said fuel in any way to a person other than those entitled to the exemption.

So much for the matters of common ground. It was contended by the appellant that its mode of operation involves use of various contractors to perform its mining activities and that to these contractors the appellant has an obligation, specified under the contracts, to supply inputs, including fuels and lubricants. It is on the above background that the appellant found surprising and unjustified the respondent's series of demands for payment of 2ps. the said TZS. 2,039,696,116.00 in total. The two contentions are strongly disputed by the respondent who maintains that the exemption was solely for the party to the MDA and as the fuels in question were consumed by persons other than the appellant, the exemption was unavailable. Both the Board and the Tribunal concluded that 3ps.

        answer: |
          The appellant found the respondent's demand for TZS. 2,039,696,116.00 surprising and unjustified because the fuel given to contractors was used for mining activities on behalf of the appellant, without any transfer, sale, or disposition violating the remission conditions.

      1ps. 1ps. To start, Mr. Mukebezi proposed to deal with the three grounds of appeal by addressing the following issues; - 1. Whether the Tribunal was correct in law in holding that among the conditions set out in GN. No. 218 of 2009 and GN No. 268 of 2010 as amended by GN. No. 190 of 2010 and GN. No. 191 of 2011 2ps. respectively, for a mining company to enjoy fuel exemption under the Mining Development Agreement with the Government of Tanzania the fuel must be used solely by a mining company in its mining activities; - 2. Whether the Tribunal was correct in law in holding that as long as the contractors were not enjoying similar privileges as those granted to the mining company, the mining company's act of allowing the fuel to be 3ps. used by the contractors cannot be tax exempt as that would run contrary to the condition that the exemption would cease the moment any disposition is made to a non- exempt and; - 3. Whether the Tribunal was correct in law in holding that the respondent's act of demanding excise duty and fuel levy on fuel given to appellant's contractors is lawful and justiciable. 2ps. 1ps. No. 218 of 2009 and GN No. 268 of 2010 as amended by GN. No. 190 of 2010 and GN. The learned counsel submitted as regards the first issue, that the appellant and the contractors are exempted by Article 6 of the MDA from paying taxes on materials or goods imported solely for the mining, so the conclusion by the Tribunal that the validity of 2ps. the exemption ceases when the user of the fuel is not the mining company itself, is wrong.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What were the three main legal issues addressed in the appeal according to Mr. Mukebezi?
        answer: |
          The issues were: (1) whether fuel must be used solely by the mining company to qualify for tax exemption; (2) whether allowing contractors to use fuel invalidates the exemption for the mining company; and (3) whether the demand for excise duty and fuel levy on fuel given to contractors is lawful.
      - question: |
          What was the Tribunal's conclusion regarding the condition for fuel tax exemption under the Mining Development Agreement?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal concluded that fuel tax exemption is valid only when the fuel is used solely by the mining company in its mining activities, and the exemption ceases if the fuel is used by non-exempt individuals or entities, such as contractors.
      - question: |
          What Government Notices (GNs) were referenced regarding conditions for fuel exemption in Tanzania?
        answer: |
          The referenced GNs are No. 218 of 2009, No. 268 of 2010, and their amendments in GN. No. 190 of 2010 and GN. No. 191 of 2011.
      - question: |
          What argument did the appellant's counsel present regarding the first issue of the appeal?
        answer: |
          The appellant's counsel argued that both the appellant and its contractors are exempted from taxes under Article 6 of the Mining Development Agreement, and therefore, the Tribunal's conclusion that the exemption ceases when fuel is used by contractors was incorrect.
      - question: |
          What is the condition under the Mining Development Agreement that allegedly invalidates the tax exemption when fuel is used by contractors?
        answer: |
          The condition is that the tax exemption ceases if any disposition is made to a non-exempt entity, such as contractors not enjoying similar privileges as the mining company.

The bottom-line consideration is the language of a particular statute and that when its language is plain, the Court need not go out of its way and interpolate. Here we may only repeat what we said in the Mwesige case that:- "Courts must presume that the legislature says in a statute what it means and means what it says: CONNECTICUT HAT'L BANK V.

        answer: |
          The cases referred to are BP Tanzania v. The Commissioner General of the Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 125 of 2015, and Republic v. Mwesige Godfrey and Another, both unreported.

          What is the 'bottom-line consideration' for statutory interpretation according to the context?
        answer: |

      1ps. 1ps. We think departing from an earlier decision should be more solemn and justified than it is in this case. Even the Rules of this Court make it clear that when a party intends to suggest a departure by the Court from its earlier decision, such intention must be reflected in the Written Submissions and special attention to it must be drawn. That is Rule 106 (3) of the Tanzania Court 2ps. of Appeal Rules, 2009, as amended. It provides; "If the parties intend to invite the Court to depart from one of its earlier decisions, this shall be clearly stated in a separate paragraph of the submissions to which special attention shall be drawn, and the intention shall also be restated as one of the reasons". In the recent amendment to the Rules made by Government Notice No. 344 of 2019, published on 26 April 2019, this provision has been re­ enacted as 3ps. sub Rule (4). 2ps. 1ps. That is Rule 106 (3) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 2009, as amended. It provides; "If the parties intend to invite the Court to depart from one of its earlier decisions, this shall be clearly stated in a separate paragraph of the submissions to which special attention shall be drawn, and the intention shall also be restated as one of the reasons". But even assuming that the omission to indicate in the 2ps. written submission would not render the prayer invalid, we are not persuaded that there are grounds for departing from the said earlier decisions of the Court. 3ps. 1ps.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What does Rule 106 (3) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 2009, require regarding a party's intention to depart from an earlier decision?
        answer: |
          Rule 106 (3) requires that if a party intends to invite the Court to depart from one of its earlier decisions, this intention must be stated clearly in a separate paragraph of the submissions, with special attention drawn to it, and restated as one of the reasons.
      - question: |
          How was Rule 106 (3) affected by the amendments introduced in 2019?
        answer: |
          The rule was re-enacted as sub Rule (4) in the 2019 amendments to the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, as published in Government Notice No. 344 of 2019 on April 26, 2019.
      - question: |
          What is the Court's perspective on the solemnity of departing from an earlier decision?
        answer: |
          The Court believes that departing from an earlier decision should be a solemn process and more justified than in the case at hand.
      - question: |
          Would a failure to comply with the procedural requirement of Rule 106 (3) automatically invalidate a party's request to depart from an earlier decision?
        answer: |
          The text states that even if the omission to indicate this intention in the written submission does not render the request invalid, the Court was still not persuaded by the grounds provided to justify departing from earlier decisions.
      - question: |
          What purpose does the requirement for special attention in submissions serve in legal proceedings according to this context?
        answer: |
          It ensures that the intention to depart from an earlier decision is explicitly highlighted, properly justified, and given due consideration by the Court.
