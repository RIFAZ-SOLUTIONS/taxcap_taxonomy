  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. This course of action by the respondents baffled us. The dispute between the parties was not at ail related to a land dispute and the parties had never referred their dispute to that court. Why should the respondents have resorted to lodge it in the land division of the High Court? Given the lousy way the respondents handled this matter from the outset compels 2ps. us to agree with Mr. Kariwa that the respondents had no intention to appeal so as to assail the decision. Fourthly, the letter by the respondents bearing Ref. No. AGC/MISC/2016/4/13 dated 21.09.2016 purporting to apply for documents for appeal purposes was addressed to the Registrar of the High Court (Main Registry). We wish to state at this juncture that even though the letter indicates "(Main Registry)" the same was 3ps. cancelled and against it the words "at Dar es Salaam" were scribbled. No initials were inserted to suggest the scribble words were in were meant to replace the "Main Registry". This adds yet another puzzle as to which court was addressed. 2ps. 1ps. We wish to state at this juncture that even though the letter indicates "(Main Registry)" the same was cancelled and against it the words "at Dar es Salaam" were scribbled. No initials were inserted to suggest the scribble words were in were meant to replace the "Main Registry". This adds yet another puzzle as to which court was addressed. The suit whose decision is sought to 2ps. be challenged was filed in the High Court, Dar es Salaam Zone. Thus, addressing the letter to the Main Registry of the High Court served no useful purpose and this enhances our worries of the respondents not intending to institute the intended appeal.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why did the respondents lodge the dispute in the land division of the High Court despite it not being related to a land dispute?
        answer: |
          The course of action by the respondents baffled the observers as the dispute was unrelated to a land matter and had never been referred to that court.
      - question: |
          What does the letter bearing Ref. No. AGC/MISC/2016/4/13 reveal about the respondents’ handling of the appeal?
        answer: |
          The letter addressed to the Registrar of the High Court (Main Registry) was later scribbled with 'at Dar es Salaam,' but it lacked initials to confirm the change, creating ambiguity about the intended court.
      - question: |
          What does the court's observation suggest about the respondents' intention to appeal the decision?
        answer: |
          The court agreed with Mr. Kariwa that the respondents likely had no intention to appeal, citing their poor handling of the matter as evidence.
      - question: |
          Why was addressing the letter to the Main Registry considered problematic?
        answer: |
          The suit was filed in the High Court, Dar es Salaam Zone, so addressing the letter to the Main Registry served no purpose and cast doubt on the respondents' intent to pursue an appeal.
      - question: |
          What administrative discrepancy further complicated the respondents’ appeal process?
        answer: |
          The cancellation of 'Main Registry' and replacement by 'at Dar es Salaam' on the letter without proper initials to authenticate the change added confusion about which court was addressed.

      1ps. 1ps. From the look of things, we, respectfully, do not think the shortcoming is an excusable keyboard mistake as Ms. Kyamba argued with some considerable force. It is our considered view that the respondents' way of handling the matter at hand leaves a lot to be desired. What explanation is given of lodging in the Land Division of the High Court a notice of appeal which had nothing to do with a 2ps. land matter? Or what made the respondents address the letter to the Registrar of the Main Registry of the High Court while the case was filed, heard and determined by the High Court, Dar es Salaam Zone? When we put these questions to Ms. Kyamba at the hearing, she did not have any plausible explanation. She ultimately surrendered the matter to the wisdom of 3ps. the Court. And to take the matter a little bit further, what prevented the respondents from filing an affidavit in reply in the year 2017 when they were served with the application? 2ps. 1ps. When we put these questions to Ms. Kyamba at the hearing, she did not have any plausible explanation. She ultimately surrendered the matter to the wisdom of the Court. And to take the matter a little bit further, what prevented the respondents from filing an affidavit in reply in the year 2017 when they were served with the application? Surely, we do not think the respondents were 2ps. not deliberately negligent in dealing with the matter at hand. In the circumstances, the authorities relied upon by the respondents; Transcontinental Forwarders Ltd (supra) and Saleh Abdi Mohamed (supra) are distinguishable from the instant case.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What explanation was provided for lodging a notice of appeal in the Land Division of the High Court for a non-land matter?
        answer: |
          The context indicates that no plausible explanation was provided by the respondents or their representative, Ms. Kyamba, during the hearing.
      - question: |
          Why was the letter to the registrar improperly addressed, and how does this relate to the case handling?
        answer: |
          The respondents addressed the letter to the Registrar of the Main Registry of the High Court instead of the High Court, Dar es Salaam Zone, where the case was filed, heard, and determined, and no satisfactory explanation was given for this error.
      - question: |
          What reasoning did Ms. Kyamba offer regarding the respondents' failure to file an affidavit in reply in 2017?
        answer: |
          Ms. Kyamba could not provide any plausible explanation for the respondents' failure to file an affidavit in reply in 2017 after being served with the application.
      - question: |
          How does the court view the respondents' handling of the matter?
        answer: |
          The court expressed the view that the respondents' handling of the matter showed deliberate negligence and their actions left much to be desired.
      - question: |
          Why were the authorities cited by the respondents deemed not applicable to the case?
        answer: |
          The authorities, Transcontinental Forwarders Ltd and Saleh Abdi Mohamed, were considered distinguishable and not relevant to the specifics of the instant case.
