  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. The Tribunal agreed with the finding of the Board. However, despite the fact that the Tribunal observed that it agreed with the Board on its reasoning and verdict, we are afraid, the verdict of the Tribunal and the Board's were the same but not the reasoning thereof. To unveil the somewhat contradiction by the Board and Tribunal in their reference to the 2ps. same paragraph and sub-section (1) of section 34, we find it apt to reproduce section 34 (1) (c) of the Income Tax Act, 1973, which was applicable then. It reads: "34.-(1) Every person shall ' upon payment of any amount to any non-resident person not having a permanent establishment in the United Republic in respect of- - (a) any management or professional fee; ## (b) any royalty; ## (c) any rent, premium or like consideration for the use or occupation of 3ps. property; - (d) any dividend; - (e) any interest; or (f) any pension or retirement annuity, which is chargeable to tax, deduct therefrom tax at the appropriate non-resident withholding tax rate." ## [Emphasis supplied]. 2ps. 1ps. We say so because, while the Board held that the payment made by the appellant to M/S Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd for purchase of computer software is taxable in terms of section 34 (1) (c) of the Income Tax Act, 1973, that is, as "any rent, premium or like consideration for the use or occupation of property", the Tribunal held that the same was taxable under, purportedly, the same section 2ps. 34 (1) (c) of the Income Tax Act, 1973, as "royalty". After a close look at the provisions of the law referred to, we think, the Board and the Tribunal used different vehicles to arrive at the same destination.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What was the primary disagreement between the Board and the Tribunal in their reasoning?
        answer: |
          The primary disagreement was that the Board classified the payment for computer software as taxable under section 34 (1) (c) as 'rent, premium or like consideration for the use or occupation of property,' while the Tribunal classified it as taxable under the same section but as 'royalty.'
      - question: |
          What does section 34 (1) (c) of the Income Tax Act, 1973, require?

          Section 34 (1) (c) of the Income Tax Act, 1973, requires tax to be deducted at the non-resident withholding tax rate from payments made to non-resident individuals not having a permanent establishment in the United Republic, such as payments for rent, premium, royalties, dividends, or interest.
      - question: |
          What type of payment was at the center of the dispute discussed in the context?

      - question: |
          How did the Tribunal and the Board differ in their legal interpretation despite agreeing on the taxable status of the payment?

          The Tribunal and the Board agreed that the payment was taxable under section 34 (1) (c), but the Tribunal interpreted it as 'royalty,' whereas the Board categorized it as 'rent, premium or like consideration for the use or occupation of property.'
      - question: |
          What observation did the Tribunal make about its reasoning compared to the Board's reasoning?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal observed that it agreed with the Board's verdict but noted that their reasoning to arrive at the verdict was different.

      1ps. 1ps. It held that the respondent was entitled to withholding tax for payments she made to her supplier for the software licence. Aggrieved, the appellant appealed to the Tribunal which, though for somewhat different reasons, upheld the decision of the Board. At the hearing of the appeal before us, the appellant appeared through Mr. Yohanes Konda and Dr. Erasmo Nyika, learned 2ps. advocates. On the other hand, Mr. Juma Kisongo, learned Principal State Attorney, assisted by Messrs. Harold Gugami and Marcel Busegano, learned Senior State Attorneys, joined forces to represent the respondent. Both parties had earlier on filed written submissions in support of their respective positions which they successfully sought to adopt as part of their oral arguments 3ps. before us.

It was Dr. Nyika who submitted for the appellant. He argued grounds 1, 3 and 4 conjointly and the remaining grounds 2 and 5 were argued separately. The essence of 2ps. the appellant's arguments on grounds 1 , 3 and 4 in the written submissions and the oral arguments by Dr. Nyika before us, is that it was an error for the Tribunal to hold that payment for the right to use software constitutes royalty and thus subject to withholding tax. It is the appellant's contention that the Tribunal wrongly 3ps. interpreted the term "royalty" under section 2 of the Income Tax Act, 1973. Dr.

      1ps. 1ps. We think the Tribunal used the 2002 Revised Edition of the Income Tax Act while the Board used the Income Tax Act, 1973 as it was before the Revised Edition of 2002. For easy reference, we reproduce the 2002 version of the Income Tax Act. It reads: "34. Thus, the "any rent, premium or like consideration for the use or occupation of property" used by the Board to hold that the payment made by the appellant to M/S 2ps. Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd was taxable, appears in para (d) of the 2002 Revised Edition whereas it appears in para (c) in the 1973 version. Be that as it may, both the Board and the Tribunal arrived at the same conclusion that payment made by the appellant to M/S Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd was taxable. The appeal before us is against the decision 3ps. of the Tribunal which held that the payment was taxable as royalty in terms of section 34 (1) (c) of the Income Tax Act, Cap. 2ps. 1ps. Thus, the "any rent, premium or like consideration for the use or occupation of property" used by the Board to hold that the payment made by the appellant to M/S Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd was taxable, appears in para (d) of the 2002 Revised Edition whereas it appears in para (c) in the 1973 version. Be that as it may, both the Board and the Tribunal arrived at the same conclusion that 2ps. payment made by the appellant to M/S Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd was taxable. 332 of the Revised Edition, 2002.

      1ps. 1ps. That, in our view, is a hallmark of a royalty subject to withholding tax and the Tribunal was justified to so hold. And, as if clinch the matter, the clause is similar with such clauses in Celtel Tanzania Ltd (supra) and National Microfinance Bank Tanzania Limited (supra). Guided by the position we took in Celtel Tanzania Ltd (supra) and National Microfinance Bank Tanzania Limited 2ps. (supra), we do not see any legal justification to depart from that position. We are not persuaded by the argument advanced by Dr. Nyika that Celtel Tanzania Ltd (supra) is distinguishable, for the obvious reason that we took the same view in National Microfinance Bank Tanzania Limited (supra) without even referring to Celtel Tanzania Ltd (supra) which Dr. Nyika would have 3ps. us hold is distinguishable. We are of the settled view in our mind that the two cases depict a correct position of the law in this jurisdiction and thus see no sound legal reason why we should depart from that sound standpoint. 2ps. 1ps.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is considered a hallmark of a royalty subject to withholding tax according to the text?
        answer: |
          The hallmark of a royalty subject to withholding tax, as noted in the text, is the justification provided by the Tribunal based on its similarity to clauses used in cases like Celtel Tanzania Ltd and National Microfinance Bank Tanzania Limited.
      - question: |
          Why did the text mention Celtel Tanzania Ltd and National Microfinance Bank Tanzania Limited cases?

          What argument by Dr. Nyika was rejected in the discussion?
        answer: |
          Dr. Nyika's argument that the Celtel Tanzania Ltd case is distinguishable was rejected because the same legal position was upheld in the National Microfinance Bank Tanzania Limited case without even referring to Celtel Tanzania Ltd.
