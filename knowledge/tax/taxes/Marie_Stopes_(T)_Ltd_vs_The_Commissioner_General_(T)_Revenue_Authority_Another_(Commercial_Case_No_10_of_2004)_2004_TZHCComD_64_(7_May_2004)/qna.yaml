The Legislature purposely used the word 'sole' to exclude original Court's jurisdiction. In trying to circumvent this, Dr. Luoga made reference to Halsbury's Law of England, 4th Edition, Vol. 1, para. 185, page 171, wherein it is stated: - "...the jurisdiction of the court is not ousted by a statutory remedy which ...in fact affords no remedy to the plaintiff for the wrong of which he complains; nor is it 2ps. ousted where the statutory remedy is otherwise inappropriate to cover the matter of which complaint is made or where a question of law is raised on which it would be advantageous to obtain an authoritative ruling from a superior court, particularly where that question relates to the scope of pre-existing legal rights encroached upon by the operation of a statute. 2ps. 1ps.
