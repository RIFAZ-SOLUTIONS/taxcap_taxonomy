      1ps. 1ps. On the strength of his arguments, Mr. Kisongo urged us to dismiss the appeal with costs for lack of merit. Mr. Mukebezi had nothing useful in rejoinder submission except reiterating what he submitted earlier and insisted his previous prayer that the appeal be allowed with costs.

It is common ground that the appellant received services from its head office in France but she did not include the same in his VAT returns for the years of income 2010 and 2011, the fact which prompted the respondent to issue an assessment for additional VAT at the tune of TZS 6,662,076,100.56. 3ps. 1ps.

In its legislative purpose and its plain statutory wording, section 43(l)(b) is intended to vest in the Commissioner General the discretion to raise an assessment o f any tax due and interest payable where in his judgment a taxable person has failed to pay any o f the tax payable by him on account of his, inter alia, failure to make any return required under the Act." It is our further view 2ps. that, given the settled position of the law in this matter, section 26 (1) of the Act contains no ambiguity or uncertainty to warrant its interpretation in favour of the appellant. As such, we do not subscribe to Mr. Mukebezi's understanding of the said provision.

We are also mindful of the fact that in his submission, Mr. Mukebezi tried to distinguish facts 2ps. of this appeal with those obtained in Mbeya Cement Company Limited (supra).
