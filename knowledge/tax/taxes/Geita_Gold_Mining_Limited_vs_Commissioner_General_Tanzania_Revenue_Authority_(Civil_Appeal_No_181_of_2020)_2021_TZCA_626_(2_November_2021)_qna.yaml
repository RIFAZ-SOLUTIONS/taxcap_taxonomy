      1ps. 1ps. It is plain that the MDAs were given legal effect through the relevant Government Notices (GNs) discussed in the decision that is to say; The Excise Tariff (Remission) (Fuel Imported by Mining Companies) Order, GN. No.480 of 2002 and Road Fuel Tolls (Remission) (Holders of Mining Licence for Gold) Order, GN No. 99 of 2ps. 2005. Accordingly, we do not see any serious issue in the MDA in the manner the Tribunal treated it as a basis for the tax relief but not an end in itself as it were. Apparently, the respondent does not dispute the fact that in terms of section 11 of the VAT read together with item 8 of the Third Schedule thereto, the appellant was relieved from VAT on importation of fuel. He only disputes the appellant's 3ps. contention that such relief extended to supplying the exempted fuel to her contractors engaged to perform certain mining services on her behalf free from VAT. 2ps. 1ps. In any event, it is our view that with or without the MDA, the dispute did not relate to the appellant's entitlement to VAT relief on imported fuel rather, whether that exemption extended to her contractors regardless of the purpose of the use of the fuel supplied to such contractors. Apparently, the respondent does not dispute the fact that in terms of 2ps. section 11 of the VAT read together with item 8 of the Third Schedule thereto, the appellant was relieved from VAT on importation of fuel. Consequently, we do not see any merit in the argument in support of issue (i) and (iv) on the power of the Minister for Energy and Minerals to enter into MDAs neither is there any dispute whether the MDA was binding or not. We thus 3ps.

Submitting in rejoinder, Mr. Kileo had three arguments. One, the factual setting in GGML case was different from the instant appeal.
