      1ps. 1ps. This course of action by the respondents baffled us. The dispute between the parties was not at ail related to a land dispute and the parties had never referred their dispute to that court. Why should the respondents have resorted to lodge it in the land division of the High Court? Given the lousy way the respondents handled this matter from the outset compels 2ps. us to agree with Mr. Kariwa that the respondents had no intention to appeal so as to assail the decision. Fourthly, the letter by the respondents bearing Ref. No. AGC/MISC/2016/4/13 dated 21.09.2016 purporting to apply for documents for appeal purposes was addressed to the Registrar of the High Court (Main Registry). We wish to state at this juncture that even though the letter indicates "(Main Registry)" the same was 3ps. cancelled and against it the words "at Dar es Salaam" were scribbled. No initials were inserted to suggest the scribble words were in were meant to replace the "Main Registry". This adds yet another puzzle as to which court was addressed. 2ps. 1ps. We wish to state at this juncture that even though the letter indicates "(Main Registry)" the same was cancelled and against it the words "at Dar es Salaam" were scribbled. No initials were inserted to suggest the scribble words were in were meant to replace the "Main Registry". This adds yet another puzzle as to which court was addressed. The suit whose decision is sought to 2ps. be challenged was filed in the High Court, Dar es Salaam Zone. Thus, addressing the letter to the Main Registry of the High Court served no useful purpose and this enhances our worries of the respondents not intending to institute the intended appeal.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why was the dispute unrelated to the Land Division of the High Court?
        answer: |
          The dispute was not related to a land issue, and the parties had not referred their dispute to the Land Division of the High Court, making it unclear why the respondents lodged it there.
      - question: |
          What does the respondents' handling of the matter suggest about their intentions?
        answer: |
          The respondents' poor handling of the matter from the outset suggests, as agreed with Mr. Kariwa, that they had no intention of appealing to challenge the decision.
      - question: |
          What irregularity was noted in the letter bearing Ref. No. AGC/MISC/2016/4/13?
        answer: |
          The letter, initially addressed to the 'Main Registry' of the High Court, had the location scribbled as 'at Dar es Salaam' without any initials to validate the change, causing confusion about which court was intended.
      - question: |
          Why was addressing the letter to the Main Registry problematic?
        answer: |
          Since the suit in question was filed in the High Court at the Dar es Salaam Zone, addressing the letter to the Main Registry served no useful purpose and raised doubts about the respondents’ intention to pursue an appeal.
      - question: |
          What specific detail heightens concern about the respondents’ intention to appeal?
        answer: |
          The lack of initials validating the scribbled change of location on the letter and the inappropriate address to the Main Registry enhance concerns that the respondents did not plan to challenge the decision through an appeal.

      1ps. 1ps. From the look of things, we, respectfully, do not think the shortcoming is an excusable keyboard mistake as Ms. Kyamba argued with some considerable force. It is our considered view that the respondents' way of handling the matter at hand leaves a lot to be desired. What explanation is given of lodging in the Land Division of the High Court a notice of appeal which had nothing to do with a 2ps. land matter? Or what made the respondents address the letter to the Registrar of the Main Registry of the High Court while the case was filed, heard and determined by the High Court, Dar es Salaam Zone? When we put these questions to Ms. Kyamba at the hearing, she did not have any plausible explanation. She ultimately surrendered the matter to the wisdom of 3ps. the Court. And to take the matter a little bit further, what prevented the respondents from filing an affidavit in reply in the year 2017 when they were served with the application? 2ps. 1ps. When we put these questions to Ms. Kyamba at the hearing, she did not have any plausible explanation. She ultimately surrendered the matter to the wisdom of the Court. And to take the matter a little bit further, what prevented the respondents from filing an affidavit in reply in the year 2017 when they were served with the application? Surely, we do not think the respondents were 2ps. not deliberately negligent in dealing with the matter at hand. In the circumstances, the authorities relied upon by the respondents; Transcontinental Forwarders Ltd (supra) and Saleh Abdi Mohamed (supra) are distinguishable from the instant case.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What did Ms. Kyamba argue regarding the shortcoming in the case?
        answer: |
          Ms. Kyamba argued that the shortcoming was an excusable keyboard mistake, though this reasoning was not accepted by the Court.
      - question: |
          What was problematic about the respondents' handling of the notice of appeal?
        answer: |
          The notice of appeal was lodged in the Land Division of the High Court even though the matter was unrelated to a land issue.
      - question: |
          Why was it questionable for the respondents to address the letter to the Registrar of the Main Registry of the High Court?
        answer: |
          It was questionable because the case was filed, heard, and determined by the High Court in the Dar es Salaam Zone, not the Main Registry.
      - question: |
          What did the respondents fail to do in 2017 that was highlighted by the Court?
        answer: |
          The respondents failed to file an affidavit in reply after being served with the application in 2017, which was viewed as negligent.
      - question: |
          Why did the Court consider the authorities cited by the respondents to be distinguishable from this case?
        answer: |
          The Court found the authorities, Transcontinental Forwarders Ltd and Saleh Abdi Mohamed, to be distinguishable because the circumstances of those cases differed significantly from the issues in the instant case.

  ### Document Outline:
  
  This legal document pertains to a civil application filed by Urban J. Mtui in the Court of Appeal of Tanzania, seeking to strike out a notice of appeal lodged by the respondents, the Commissioner General of the Tanzania Revenue Authority and the Attorney General. The case revolves around a High Court judgment in favor of the applicant, awarding damages and interest, but the respondents' delayed filing of the notice of appeal, referencing incorrect case details, is contested for allegedly not taking essential steps to further their appeal.
