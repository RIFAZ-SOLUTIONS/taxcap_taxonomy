  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. Mr. Bhojan contended that the appellant should have filed this i appeal latest by 24/04/2017 which was a Monday, but not as he did on 27/04/2017. He instead questioned the competence of Appeal No. 27 of 2011 which the respondent had initiated in the Board. In his opinion, the appeal to the Board should have been backed up by a Notice of Appeal to the Board. He 2ps. submitted further that considering that Notice of Appeal to the Board is a mandatory document under Rule 4 (1) of the Tax Revenue Appeal Board Rules, 2001 GN No.57 of 2001 (Board Rules), the proceedings, before the Board, the judgment and the decree of the Board, are all defective for want of support of the Notice of Appeal to the Board. He further submitted that 3ps. Rule 7 of the Board Rules recognizes Notice of Appeal to the Board as a material document, which he contended was not even served on the appellant. 2ps. 1ps. In his opinion, the appeal to the Board should have been backed up by a Notice of Appeal to the Board. He submitted further that considering that Notice of Appeal to the Board is a mandatory document under Rule 4 (1) of the Tax Revenue Appeal Board Rules, 2001 GN No.57 of 2001 (Board Rules), the proceedings, before the Board, the judgment 2ps. and the decree of the Board, are all defective for want of support of the Notice of Appeal to the Board. From the submissions of the two learned counsel for the parties, and after perusing the record of appeal, we are satisfied that the only question for our determination is whether this appeal was filed within the prescribed sixty days' limitation period when it was 3ps. filed on 27/4/2017.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What was Mr. Bhojan's contention about the filing date of the appeal?
        answer: |
          Mr. Bhojan contended that the appellant should have filed the appeal by 24/04/2017, a Monday, but instead filed it late on 27/04/2017.
      - question: |
          What document did Mr. Bhojan argue was mandatory under the Tax Revenue Appeal Board Rules, 2001?
        answer: |
          Mr. Bhojan argued that the Notice of Appeal to the Board was a mandatory document under Rule 4 (1) of the Tax Revenue Appeal Board Rules, 2001 GN No.57 of 2001.
      - question: |
          What did Mr. Bhojan claim was defective due to the lack of a mandatory Notice of Appeal?
        answer: |
          He claimed that the proceedings before the Board, as well as the judgment and decree of the Board, were defective due to the absence of the mandatory Notice of Appeal to the Board.
      - question: |
          What does Rule 7 of the Board Rules acknowledge about the Notice of Appeal?
        answer: |
          Rule 7 of the Board Rules acknowledges the Notice of Appeal to the Board as a material document.
      - question: |
          What was the primary question determined in the case based on the submissions and records?
        answer: |
          The primary question was whether the appeal, filed on 27/04/2017, was submitted within the prescribed sixty-day limitation period.
  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. Therefore, the question whether this appeal was filed within the prescribed sixty days, will be determined by looking at the sixty days counted from the date when the notice of appeal was filed, to the date when the appeal is instituted. It is a common cause that the appellant filed his fresh notice of appeal on 11/03/2016, and it took another five days until 16/03/2016 when he 2ps. applied to the Registrar of the Tribunal for a copy of the proceedings which was received on 27/02/2017. But, Mr. Bhojan has staked a position that it had taken the appellant more than sixty days to file his memorandum and record of appeal to be lodged because of the earlier five (5) days between 11/3/2016 and 16/3/2016 when the appellant had sat back after filing his notice of 3ps. appeal. In his reckoning, the total number of days added up to sixty four (64) days which is beyond the prescribed period of sixty days. 2ps. 1ps. There is no doubt from the record of appeal that the period from the date when the appellant received a copy of the proceedings to 27/4/2017 when the appellant filed memorandum and record of appeal to initiate this appeal, adds up to a total of fifty nine (59) days. In his reckoning, the total number of days added up to sixty four (64) days which is beyond the prescribed period of sixty days. We think 2ps. Mr. Bhojan is correct in his conclusions that although the appellant filed his memorandum and record of appeal fifty-nine (days) after receiving the copy of proceedings from the Registrar of the Tribunal, he has not accounted for the five days he took no action after the filing of notice of appeal.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the prescribed time limit for filing an appeal after submitting a notice of appeal?
        answer: |
          The prescribed time limit for filing an appeal after submitting a notice of appeal is sixty days.
      - question: |
          When did the appellant file the fresh notice of appeal?
        answer: |
          The appellant filed the fresh notice of appeal on 11/03/2016.
      - question: |
          How many days passed before the appellant applied for a copy of the proceedings after filing the notice of appeal?
        answer: |
          Five days passed before the appellant applied for a copy of the proceedings after filing the notice of appeal, from 11/03/2016 to 16/03/2016.
      - question: |
          What was the total duration between receiving the copy of proceedings and filing the memorandum and record of appeal?
        answer: |
          The total duration between receiving the copy of proceedings and filing the memorandum and record of appeal was fifty-nine (59) days.
      - question: |
          Why did Mr. Bhojan conclude that the appellant exceeded the sixty-day time limit?
        answer: |
          Mr. Bhojan concluded the appellant exceeded the sixty-day time limit by adding the five days of inaction after the filing of the notice of appeal to the fifty-nine days it took to file the memorandum and record of appeal, summing it to sixty-four days.
  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps.
      It  is  also  clear  from  the  record  of  appeal  that  the  Certificate  of
         Delay which  the  appellant obtained,  did  not cover the  five  days which
         the appellant has not accounted for.  In so far as the sixty days limitation
         period  is concerned,  the Certificate of Delay which the  Registrar issued
         cannot be of any benefit to the appellant.   Decisions of the Court are now
         unanimous that failure of the appellant to institute a civil  appeal
      2ps.  within  the  prescribed  sixty  (60)  days  renders  the  appeal incompetent:
         For exampleHenry William vs. Anyigulile, Mwasomola, CIVIL APPEAL NO. 81 OF
         2014 (unreported).
      In result, the  appellant  having lodged  the
         memorandum  and record  of appeal  beyond  the  60  days  prescribed  by Rule
          90  (1)  of the
      Rules,  this appeal  is not competently  before  us.   It
         is  hereby struck  out.
      The costs shall lie where they fall.
