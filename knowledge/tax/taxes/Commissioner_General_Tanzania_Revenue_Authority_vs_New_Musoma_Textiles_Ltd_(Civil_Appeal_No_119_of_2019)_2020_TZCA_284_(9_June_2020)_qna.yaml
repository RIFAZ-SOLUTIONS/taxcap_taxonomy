      1ps. 1ps. We hasten to say that the complaints in the second and third grounds of appeal are equally unmerited. To begin with, we agree with Mr. Sungwa that the Tribunal did not invoke or apply the provisions of section 21 (1) of the LMA to determine the appeal before it; for, it was clearly cognizant that the LMA was inapplicable to that dispute because section 43 (d) of that law disapplied it from forfeiture proceedings under the Customs (Management and Tariff) Act or the Excise (Management and 2ps. Tariff) Act. As shown in the above excerpted passage, the Tribunal clearly stated that the Board should have invoked "the inspiration provided by the principle under section 21 (1) of the Law of Limitation Act, at least with regard to the grounds for extension of time." 2ps. 1ps.

In view of the apparent fluidity and 2ps. flexibility of the phrase "other reasonable cause", the Tribunal was justified to hold that the Board should have invoked the spirit of the principle under section 21 (1) of the LMA that the time during which the respondent was prosecuting a civil proceeding in a wrong forum with due diligence and in good faith ought to be excluded, which effectively constituted a reasonable cause for the delay. 3ps. 1ps.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why did the Tribunal refrain from applying section 21 (1) of the Law of Limitation Act (LMA)?

          The Tribunal refrained from applying section 21 (1) of the LMA because section 43 (d) of the same law explicitly disapplied it in forfeiture proceedings under the Customs (Management and Tariff) Act or the Excise (Management and Tariff) Act.
      - question: |
          What principle under section 21 (1) of the LMA did the Tribunal suggest could have been invoked?

          The Tribunal suggested that the spirit of the principle under section 21 (1) of the LMA, which permits exclusion of time spent pursuing a civil proceeding in a wrong forum with due diligence and good faith as a reasonable cause for delay, could have been invoked.
      - question: |
          What did the Tribunal state about the phrase 'other reasonable cause' in the context of delay? 
        answer: |
          The Tribunal noted that the phrase 'other reasonable cause' was fluid and flexible, allowing for the principle under section 21 (1) of the LMA to be considered in determining if the delay was justified.
      - question: |
          What was Mr. Sungwa’s argument that the Tribunal agreed with?
        answer: |
          Mr. Sungwa argued that the Tribunal did not invoke section 21 (1) of the LMA to resolve the appeal because it was inapplicable to the dispute, which the Tribunal confirmed and agreed with.
      - question: |
          What specific action did the Tribunal believe the Board should have taken?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal believed that the Board should have drawn inspiration from the principle under section 21 (1) of the LMA relating to exclusion of time for delays due to pursuing claims in a wrong forum with diligence and good faith.
