They denied issuance of seizure notice saying that the one which is alleged to have been issued on 13th November 2003 was issued before the matter was marked settled and was issued unilaterally and without compliance with the requirements of the law. Basically those were the arguments given by the Advocates in this case. After a thorough scrutiny of the documents filed and the submissions made, this court agree with Mr. Lugaiya that there must be something wrong in the filing of the present suit. If the case which was filed at Bagamoyo District Court was filed by the 2ps. person who purported to be the owner of the consignment, which also forms the subject matter of this suit, there is no reason why these proceedings should be filed by the Captain of the Vessel and not the owner. Even the plaint does not make any reference at all to the suit which was filed at Bagamoyo. This omission suggests that the plaintiffs were trying to evade an objection on re- judicata. 2ps. 1ps.

      - question: |
          What did the court find suspicious about the filing of the present suit?
        answer: |
          The court found it suspicious that the case was filed by the Captain of the Vessel instead of the owner of the consignment and that the plaint made no reference to a prior related suit filed at the Bagamoyo District Court, suggesting an attempt to evade a re-judicata objection.
