      1ps. 1ps. We hasten to say that the complaints in the second and third grounds of appeal are equally unmerited. To begin with, we agree with Mr. Sungwa that the Tribunal did not invoke or apply the provisions of section 21 (1) of the LMA to determine the appeal before it; for, it was clearly cognizant that the LMA was inapplicable to that dispute because section 43 (d) of that law disapplied it from forfeiture proceedings under the Customs (Management and Tariff) Act or the Excise (Management and 2ps. Tariff) Act. As shown in the above excerpted passage, the Tribunal clearly stated that the Board should have invoked "the inspiration provided by the principle under section 21 (1) of the Law of Limitation Act, at least with regard to the grounds for extension of time." 2ps. 1ps. To begin with, we agree with Mr. Sungwa that the Tribunal did not invoke or apply the provisions of section 21 (1) of the LMA to determine the appeal before it; for, it was clearly cognizant that the LMA was inapplicable to that dispute because section 43 (d) of that law disapplied it from forfeiture proceedings under the Customs (Management and Tariff) Act or the Excise (Management and Tariff) Act. In view of the apparent fluidity and 2ps. flexibility of the phrase "other reasonable cause", the Tribunal was justified to hold that the Board should have invoked the spirit of the principle under section 21 (1) of the LMA that the time during which the respondent was prosecuting a civil proceeding in a wrong forum with due diligence and in good faith ought to be excluded, which effectively constituted a reasonable cause for the delay. 3ps. 1ps.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why did the Tribunal find that the provisions of section 21 (1) of the Law of Limitation Act (LMA) were not applicable to the appeal?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal determined that section 21 (1) of the LMA was inapplicable because section 43 (d) of the LMA explicitly excluded forfeiture proceedings under the Customs (Management and Tariff) Act or the Excise (Management and Tariff) Act from its application.
      - question: |
          What principle did the Tribunal believe the Board should have considered in the absence of applying section 21 (1) of the LMA?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal believed the Board should have considered the principle under section 21 (1) of the LMA that the time spent prosecuting a civil proceeding in a wrong forum, if done with due diligence and in good faith, should be excluded as a reasonable cause for the delay.
      - question: |
          What phrase did the Tribunal consider sufficiently flexible to justify the respondent’s delay?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal considered the phrase 'other reasonable cause' sufficiently flexible to justify the respondent’s delay.
      - question: |
          What was Mr. Sungwa’s position regarding the applicability of section 21 (1) of the LMA to the dispute?
        answer: |
          Mr. Sungwa argued that the Tribunal did not invoke or apply section 21 (1) of the LMA, as it was cognizant that the LMA was inapplicable to the dispute based on section 43 (d) of the law.
      - question: |
          What was the Tribunal’s perspective on how the Board handled the issue of time extension in the case?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal stated that the Board should have been guided by the principle under section 21 (1) of the LMA, which allows for the exclusion of time spent pursuing a civil case in a wrong forum with due diligence and good faith when determining reasonable cause for a delay.
