  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps.   This lofty legislative intention could  hardly be achieved if the signal "Sgd"
         could be accepted to stand  for  the  members'  full  signature.  This  is
         because  such entries  are  vulnerable  to  abuse.  That  said,  we  agree 
         with  the learned  counsel that the copy of the decision that appears in the
         record of appeal is not signed. 
      
      In AMI  PORT  OPERATIONS  (T)  LIMITED  vs 
         THE COMMISSIONER  FOR  INCOME  TAX  Civil
      
      2ps. Appeal  No.  28  of 2009 (Dsm) (unreported) we held, that failure by the members
         to sign the copy of the decision  renders  it defective and this  infects the
         record of appeal in terms of rule 24(3) of the Rules and rule
      
      96 (2) (e) of
         the Court of Appeal Rules, 2009. A defective record of appeal cannot sustain
         an appeal in this Court. 
      
      For the above reasons we agree that the appeal is
         incompetent.  It is therefore struck out.  We make no order as to costs.
         
      
      Order accordingly.
