      1ps. 1ps. The answer to the question is found in the application itself. The order which is sought to be stayed was issued by the Commissioner of VAT and it relates to stamp duty. The above answer is a pointer that the matter falls under section 7 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act because it arose out of the Stamp Duty Act, which is one of the revenue laws administered by the respondent. (See Section 5(1)(a) of the Tanzania Revenue Authority Act - Cap 399 and the First Schedule - Item 6). This is also a matter which 2ps. has been admitted by Dr. Nguluma that an appeal has already been filed at the Tax Appeals Board. This court therefore has no jurisdiction. Dr. Nguluma said the decisions cited are not binding on me. It is true they are decisions made by My Brother Judges but they are explicit on the position of the law. I share their views. There is no reason for me to depart from the decisions. 2ps. 1ps. It is true they are decisions made by My Brother Judges but they are explicit on the position of the law. I share their views. There is no reason for me to depart from the decisions. See also the decision of Massati, J in Sunday Sanga T/A ITUMBA ## TRADING COMPANY VS TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY Commercial Case No.26 of 2005 (Unreported). From Dr. Nguluma's submission, he came to this court to ensure that his client is being protected while the appeal is being persued in the Tax Appeals Board. He said it does not appear that 2ps. the Board has got powers to grant temporary reliefs. I think Dr. Nguluma is wrong. Part IV of the Tax Revenue Act, 2000 Cap 408 deals with appeals generally.

      1ps. 1ps. Order XXXIX rule 5(2), (3) and (4) is concerned with stay of execution of decrees issued by the Court of Resident Magistrate and the District Court. That stay can only be granted if the appeal is to be heard by the High Court and not by any other machinery. The application before this court seeks to stay a restraint order issued by the Commissioner for VAT. The restraint order does not fall within the ambit of what is envisaged by the provisions under which the application has been preferred. There is no provision in the Tax Revenue 2ps. Act, 2000 which allows the kind of application filed by Dr. Nguluma to be entertained by the High Court under the provision which this application has been preferred. 2ps. 1ps.

In all the three cases, the Court of Appeal held that failure to cite proper provision of the law renders the application incompetent.
