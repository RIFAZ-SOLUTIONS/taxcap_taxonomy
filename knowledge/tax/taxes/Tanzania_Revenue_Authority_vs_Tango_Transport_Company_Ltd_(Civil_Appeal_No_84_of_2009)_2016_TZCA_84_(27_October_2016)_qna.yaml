      1ps. 1ps. Mr. Ohhay-Sang'ka went on to submit that the High Court's jurisdiction, which a court should jealously guard and not lightly oust, had not been specifically ousted by the Income Tax Act. He relied on Gosbert Mujumuzi v. Dihimulali Matende [1969] H.C.D. 138 and Mtenga v. University of Dar es Salaam [1971] H.C.D. 247. He contended that the suit was not a pure tax dispute. The Income Tax Act did not completely oust the jurisdiction 2ps. of the High Court to try a dispute which involved the award of damages for unlawful distrain by T.R.A. The suit could also not have been determined under the Income Tax Act as it had no provisions granting the respondent a right to damages. The Income Tax Act did not bar or oust the civil court's jurisdiction to deal with non-tax matters or 3ps. the warrant of distress executed outside the law, one and a half years after its invalid issuance. The authorities cited by T.R.A., he submitted, were decided before the coming into effect of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, Cap. 2ps. 1ps. The suit could also not have been determined under the Income Tax Act as it had no provisions granting the respondent a right to damages.

No. 126 of 29/06/2001). We now advert to the merits of ground one of the memorandum of appeal. 'Jurisdiction' is defined in Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol.

This court observed that it is necessary to bear in mind the important principle of construction which is that if a statute excluded the ordinary jurisdiction of a civil court it must do so either by express terms or by the use of such terms as would necessarily lead to the inference of such 2ps. exclusion.
