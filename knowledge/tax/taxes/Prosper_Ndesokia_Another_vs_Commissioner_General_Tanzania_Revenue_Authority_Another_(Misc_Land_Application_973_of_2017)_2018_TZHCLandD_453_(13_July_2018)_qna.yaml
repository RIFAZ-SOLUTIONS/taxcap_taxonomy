  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. Upon perusal of the application at hand, I would agree with Mr. Nyika that this is a land matter in which the applicants' properties are about to be sold by the respondents. That it is a dispute concerning land whose jurisdiction is vested upon this court under Section 167 of the Land Act Cap. 133 RE.E. 2002 and Section 37 of the Land Disputes Courts Act Cap. 2ps. 216 R.E. 2002. However as the applicant concedes that matter is in respect of execution of the Tax Tribunals Order then I believe it was proper to first appeal to the Board as provided for under sections 7 and 12 of the Tax Revenue Appeals. Applicants maintain that this cause is for challenging the distant of its goods because it had settled its tax liabilites. The same could thus be resolved at the tribunal and not at this Court because 3ps. it is all in respect of tax and there is no dispute in respect of ownership of the said landed properties as conceded by the applicants. 2ps. 1ps. 216 R.E. 2002. However as the applicant concedes that matter is in respect of execution of the Tax Tribunals Order then I believe it was proper to first appeal to the Board as provided for under sections 7 and 12 of the Tax Revenue Appeals. Applicants maintain that this cause is for challenging the distant of its goods because it had settled its tax liabilites. In the circumstances, I uphold the 1s t ground 2ps. of preliminary objection that this is not purely a dispute on land ownership but originates from execution of a decision done by another tribunal which has jurisdiction to resolve the same. This Court thus has no jurisdiction at this juncture to entertain the same.
