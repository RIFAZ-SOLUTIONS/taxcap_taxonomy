      1ps. 1ps. In its decision, the Board held as follows: one, that the appellant did not provide evidence that the commission income was properly reversed as the law required; two, that there was equally no evidence of overstatement of commission income or how the figure was arrived at; and three, that there was no convincing evidence that the alleged reversal was a result of adjustment intended to comply with the 2ps. Atlas Group's transfer pricing policy. On appeal, the Tribunal substantially upheld the Board's decision. It ruled that the alleged errors in the appellant's books were materially doubtful because the appellant ought to have been aware of its group's pricing policy. If it failed to comply with its transfer pricing policy at the 3ps. material time, it could not invoke it retrospectively to effectively reduce its tax liability. Furthermore, the Tribunal was categorical that the appellant's explanations as to what happened after learning that the commissions earned from its sister companies were taxable to VAT were unconvincing. 2ps. 1ps.

If it failed to comply with its transfer pricing policy at the material time, it could not invoke it retrospectively to effectively reduce its tax liability.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What were the three key points held by the Board in its decision?
        answer: |
          The Board held that (1) the appellant did not provide evidence that the commission income was properly reversed as required by law, (2) there was no evidence of overstatement of commission income or how the figure was determined, and (3) there was no convincing evidence that the alleged reversal was intended to comply with Atlas Group's transfer pricing policy.
      - question: |
          Why did the Tribunal uphold the Board's decision?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal upheld the decision because it found the alleged errors in the appellant's books to be materially doubtful and concluded that the appellant's failure to follow its group's transfer pricing policy at the material time invalidated any retrospective invocation of the policy to reduce tax liability.
      - question: |
          What was the Tribunal's stance regarding the appellant's explanations on VAT taxation of commissions from sister companies?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal found the appellant's explanations unconvincing regarding the actions taken after learning that commissions earned from its sister companies were taxable to VAT.
      - question: |
          What primary grievance did the appellant raise in its Memorandum of Appeal?
        answer: |
          One primary grievance raised by the appellant was that the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law by holding that the appellant could not retrospectively invoke the group's transfer pricing policy.
      - question: |
          Why did the Tribunal view the appellant's invocation of the transfer pricing policy as invalid?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal viewed the invocation as invalid because the appellant was expected to be aware of the group's transfer pricing policy at the material time and could not use it retroactively to reduce tax liability.

In the former case, we held as follows: 'We agree with the Tribunal that this was a question o f fact in terms o f section 28(2)(b) o f the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, the burden o f proof was on the appellant to prove that the said equipment was used wholly and exclusively for purposes o f mining operations. In the fin d in g o f the T ribunal, the appellant had fa ile d to discharge the burden. This 2ps. is so, because under section 25(2) o f the Tax Revenue Appeals A ct (CAP 408 RE 2002) appeals to th is C ourt lie only on m atters in v o lv in g q u e stio n s o f law . So, we find that the fifth ground is devoid o f substance and we dismiss it "[Emphasis added] Similarly, the complaint in the second ground that the Tribunal " erred in law when it held that the appellant earned the reversed incom e" 3ps. raises no interpretational or application of law issue. 2ps. 1ps. This being a question o f fa ct it ends there. This is so, because under section 25(2) o f the Tax Revenue Appeals A ct (CAP 408 RE 2002) appeals to th is C ourt lie only on m atters in v o lv in g q u e stio n s o f law . Nor does it posit that the finding that the impugned finding that the "reversed 2ps. income" was earned was based on no evidence or that it was a perverse finding.

        answer: |

          Why was the complaint regarding the Tribunal's finding on 'reversed income' dismissed?
        answer: |

          What does the Tribunal's decision emphasize regarding cases involving questions of fact?

      - question: |
          What type of error in the Tribunal’s findings would potentially allow an appeal to the court?
        answer: |
          An appeal could potentially be allowed if it were shown that the Tribunal’s finding was based on no evidence or was a perverse finding.

His essential oral submission, based on the written submissions that the respondent had filed in advance in terms of Rule 106 (2) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 2009 ("the Rules"), was that none of the 2ps. four grounds of appeal presented by the appellant in the Memorandum of Appeal discloses a question of law, but a factual controversy.

He further contended that the appellant's failure to file written submissions in support of the appeal or in opposition to the preliminary objection cemented the respondent's position.

Having closely examined the record of appeal as well as the memorandum of appeal and after full consideration of the respondent's written submissions in tandem 2ps. with the parties' oral arguments, we think two issues arise for our determination. First, as both parties agree that in terms of section 25 (2) of the TRAA an appeal to this Court from a decision of the Tribunal lies on matters involving questions of law only, then, it behoves the Court to determine what a question of law is. Secondly, whether the 3ps. four grounds of appeal raised in the present appeal involve questions of law. As a starting point on what a question of law entails, we wish to acknowledge that it is not the first time that the Court is confronting this subject. 2ps. 1ps.
