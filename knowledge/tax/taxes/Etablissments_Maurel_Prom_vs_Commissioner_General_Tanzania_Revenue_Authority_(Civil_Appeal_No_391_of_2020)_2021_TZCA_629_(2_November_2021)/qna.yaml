      1ps. 1ps. On the strength of his arguments, Mr. Kisongo urged us to dismiss the appeal with costs for lack of merit. Mr. Mukebezi had nothing useful in rejoinder submission except reiterating what he submitted earlier and insisted his previous prayer that the appeal be allowed with costs. As intimated above, it is not in dispute that the appellant is a Tanzania registered branch of Etablissments Maurel &amp; Prom, an entity incorporated 2ps. and registered in France conducting exploration activities of oil and gas in Tanzania, thus a taxable person and a registered tax payer.

Having carefully considered the rival submissions made by the counsel for the parties in support and against the appeal, we find that the main issue for our consideration under the first and second issues is whether the Tribunal erred in holding that the appellant, a taxable person and a recipient of imported services who is exempted under Article 12 (1) (a) of the PSA 2ps. was under any obligation to file VAT returns on the imported services. It is common ground that the appellant received services from its head office in France but she did not include the same in his VAT returns for the years of income 2010 and 2011, the fact which prompted the respondent to issue an assessment for additional VAT at the tune of TZS 6,662,076,100.56. 3ps. 1ps.

      - question: |
          Why did the respondent issue an additional VAT assessment against the appellant, and for what amount?
        answer: |

          What was the central issue under consideration regarding the appellant's VAT reporting obligations?

It is our further view 2ps. that, given the settled position of the law in this matter, section 26 (1) of the Act contains no ambiguity or uncertainty to warrant its interpretation in favour of the appellant. As such, we do not subscribe to Mr. Mukebezi's understanding of the said provision. We are also mindful of the fact that in his submission, Mr. Mukebezi tried to distinguish facts of this appeal with those obtained in Mbeya Cement 3ps. Company Limited (supra). 2ps. 1ps.

We are also mindful of the fact that in his submission, Mr. Mukebezi tried to distinguish facts 2ps. of this appeal with those obtained in Mbeya Cement Company Limited (supra). Having scrutinized the facts in the two cases, we again find the submission of Mr. Mukebezi to be misconceived as in both cases the appellants who are taxable persons lodged improper tax returns without including imported services contrary to the law. With profound respect, we hold the firm view that the invitation extended to us by Mr. Mukebezi to 3ps.
