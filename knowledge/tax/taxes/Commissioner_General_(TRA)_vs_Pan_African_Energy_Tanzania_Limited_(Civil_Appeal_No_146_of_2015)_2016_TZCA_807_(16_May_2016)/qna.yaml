      1ps. 1ps. What is stressed in the section is that the services must be rendered in Tanzania. This could be a leeway for tax evasion for unfaithful businessmen or for unlawful transactions.

The cases of Cape Brandy Syndicate (supra) and that of Commissioner General Another V Mac Arthur and baker International(supra) guide the court on interpretation of the statutes. We cannot create 2ps. a situation in the statute that was not intended by the Legislature.

Where the government is the payer, income tax is chargeable regardless of the place where the services are rendered. It is chargeable even when it is rendered outside the United Republic.

Other jurisdictions, like the government of India changed the law and is now in a position to charge income even for services rendered outside India but payment made in India. See the case of Ashapura Minishem Ltd (supra).
