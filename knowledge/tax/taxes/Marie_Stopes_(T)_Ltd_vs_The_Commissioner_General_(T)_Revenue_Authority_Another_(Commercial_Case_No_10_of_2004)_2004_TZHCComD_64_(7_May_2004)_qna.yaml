      1ps. 1ps. 5 above quoted shows that charitable organizations are generally exempted from taxes but have to satisfy the Commissioner that their income falls within the exempted parameters. The Legislature purposely used the word 'sole' to exclude original Court's jurisdiction. In trying to circumvent this, Dr. Luoga made reference to Halsbury's Law of England, 4th Edition, Vol. 1, para. 185, page 171, wherein it is stated: - "...the jurisdiction of the court is not ousted by a statutory remedy which ...in fact affords no remedy to the plaintiff for the wrong of which he complains; nor is it 2ps. ousted where the statutory remedy is otherwise inappropriate to cover the matter of which complaint is made or where a question of law is raised on which it would be advantageous to obtain an authoritative ruling from a superior court, particularly where that question relates to the scope of pre-existing legal rights encroached upon by the operation of a statute. 2ps. 1ps. In trying to circumvent this, Dr. Luoga made reference to Halsbury's Law of England, 4th Edition, Vol. 1, para. ' The above quoted notwithstanding, we have the guidance of our highest Court of the Land, the Court of Appeal in Attorney General v Lohay Akonaay and Joseph Lohay [1995] TLR 80 at 96 - ' ...Courts would not normally entertain a matter for which a special forum has been established, unless the aggrieved party can satisfy the Court that no appropriate remedy is available in the special forum '. Now, what the Plaintiffs are seeking, that is, whether they 2ps. are liable to pay tax is very much within the Board's powers as it is vested with jurisdiction to consider an appeal by a person who is challenging the Commissioner's assessment/decision.

      - question: |

  **Document Outline:**
  
  The document details a legal dispute heard in the High Court of Tanzania (Commercial Division) between Marie Stopes Tanzania Limited (Plaintiff) and the Tanzania Revenue Authority (Defendants). The Defendants raised a preliminary objection, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction under the Tax Revenue Appeals Act to adjudicate the matter, which stemmed from a tax assessment of TZS 77,625,000 that the Plaintiff contested, claiming charitable organization status and exemption from corporate tax. The Plaintiff sought declaratory reliefs and recovery of funds appropriated by the Defendants.
