      1ps. 1ps. This lofty legislative intention could hardly be achieved if the signal "Sgd" could be accepted to stand for the members' full signature. This is because such entries are vulnerable to abuse. That said, we agree with the learned counsel that the copy of the decision that appears in the record of appeal is not signed. In AMI PORT OPERATIONS (T) LIMITED vs THE COMMISSIONER FOR INCOME TAX Civil 2ps. Appeal No. 28 of 2009 (Dsm) (unreported) we held, that failure by the members to sign the copy of the decision renders it defective and this infects the record of appeal in terms of rule 24(3) of the Rules and rule 96 (2) (e) of the Court of Appeal Rules, 2009. A defective record of appeal cannot sustain an appeal in this Court. For the above reasons we agree that the appeal is incompetent. It is therefore struck out. We make no order as to costs. Order accordingly. 2ps. 1ps. It is therefore struck out. We make no order as to costs. Order accordingly. DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this 23r d day of February, 2016. ## M.C. OTHMAN CHIEF JUSTICE
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why can't the signal 'Sgd' be considered equivalent to the members' full signature?
        answer: |
          The signal 'Sgd' cannot be equated to the members' full signature because such entries are vulnerable to abuse and do not reflect the level of authenticity required for legislative purposes.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What was Mr. Vedasto's stance on the preliminary objection?

          Mr. Vedasto did not contest the preliminary objection and conceded to it, praying that the incompetent appeal be struck out with no order as to costs.
      - question: |
          What does Rule 21 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal, Rules, 2001 require for tribunal decisions?
        answer: |
          Rule 21 requires the tribunal to make a decision as soon as practicable in the presence of the parties or their representatives and provide a signed and certified copy of the decision to each party.

          How did Mr. Beleko respond to the preliminary objection?
        answer: |
          Mr. Beleko agreed that the incompetent appeal be struck out with no order as to costs.
      - question: |
          Where can the tribunal's decision titled 'Judgment' be found in the record?
        answer: |
          The tribunal's decision titled 'Judgment' can be found on pages 157 to 161 of the record.
      - question: |
          How is the tribunal members' certification indicated in the decision?
        answer: |
          The certification by the tribunal members is indicated on page 161 of the decision, where the signal 'Sgd' appears beside each member's name.
  - context: |
      each member's name the signal "Sgd" is indicated. We do not think that the signal "Sgd" beside each member's name is sufficient evidence that the said members did sign at the end of the decision. We believe that the purpose of requiring the members in the tribunal to sign the decision is 2ps. not only to authenticate, but also for the said members to own the said decision. This lofty legislative intention could hardly be achieved if the signal "Sgd" could be accepted to stand for the members' full signature. This is because such entries are vulnerable to abuse. That said, we agree with the learned counsel that the copy of the decision that appears in the record of appeal is not 3ps. signed.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What does the signal 'Sgd' indicate in the context of the tribunal members' names?
        answer: |
          The signal 'Sgd' is meant to indicate that a member has signed the decision.
      - question: |
          Why is the signal 'Sgd' considered insufficient evidence of a signature?
        answer: |
          It is considered insufficient because it does not authenticate the decision or ensure that the members take ownership of it, as required by legislative intent.
      - question: |
          What are the two purposes of requiring tribunal members to sign a decision?
        answer: |
          The purposes are to authenticate the decision and to ensure that members take ownership of the decision.
      - question: |
          Why is the use of the signal 'Sgd' seen as problematic?
        answer: |
          It is seen as problematic because such entries are vulnerable to abuse.
      - question: |
          What conclusion was reached about the decision in the record of appeal?
        answer: |
          It was concluded that the copy of the decision in the record of appeal is not signed.
