Civil Application No. 8 of 2014 (unreported), where it was held: " The discretion o f the Court to extend time under Rule 10 is unfettered, but it has also been held that, in considering an application under the rule, the Court may take into consideration, such factors as, the length o f the delay, the reason for the delay, the chance o f success o f the intended appeal, and the degree o f prejudice that the ## respondent may 3ps. suffer if the application is granted". 3ps. 1ps.

Therefore, in deciding whether or not to grant it, the court is expected as well to consider the reason for the delay and the degree of prejudice that the respondent may suffer if the application is granted. I have taken time to consider the element of illegality relied upon by the applicants in line with the history and circumstances surrounding the case. I am settled, in 2ps. my mind that; the illegality sought to be corrected in the intended appeal is not of sufficient importance. More so, I am settled that, the grant of the order will lead to serious injustice on the part of the respondent. I have two reasons to justify my view. First, the case at the

I have two reasons to justify my view. First, the case at the trial court was initiated in 2001 when the defunct ICT was still in operation.

In my view, as the law and dispute settlement machineries under which the jurisdictional issue is based are no longer in existence, it is a matter of common 2ps. sense that, the intended correction of illegality is not of sufficient importance. Second and more importantly, this dispute has been pending in courts since 2001. It is now 23 years old. It relates to the fate of the service of the respondent. This means that, throughout this time, the respondent is unemployed. The facts in the affidavits suggest that, while the applicants 3ps. are responsible for this very inordinate delay and sometime by their negligent inaction, the respondent is not. Obviously, therefore, the grant of the application will occasion serious injustice on the part of the respondent It will not serve any meaningful purpose as well. 5ps. 1ps.
