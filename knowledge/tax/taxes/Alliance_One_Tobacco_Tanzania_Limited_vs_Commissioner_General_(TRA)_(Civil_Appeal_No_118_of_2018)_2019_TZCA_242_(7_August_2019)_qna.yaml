There are no clear reasons provided by TRA for disallowing the inventory costs. And the failure to state the reasons for disallowing is on itself an act of arbitrary. There is a second reason why you should find in favour of the tax payer in this point. In making the transfer pricing adjustment the 2ps. cosb of inventory is automatically adjusted.
