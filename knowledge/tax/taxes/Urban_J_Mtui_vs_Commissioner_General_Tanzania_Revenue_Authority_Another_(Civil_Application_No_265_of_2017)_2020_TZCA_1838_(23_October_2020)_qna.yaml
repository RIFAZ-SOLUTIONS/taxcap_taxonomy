  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. This course of action by the respondents baffled us. The dispute between the parties was not at ail related to a land dispute and the parties had never referred their dispute to that court. Why should the respondents have resorted to lodge it in the land division of the High Court? Given the lousy way the respondents handled this matter from the outset compels 2ps. us to agree with Mr. Kariwa that the respondents had no intention to appeal so as to assail the decision. Fourthly, the letter by the respondents bearing Ref. No. AGC/MISC/2016/4/13 dated 21.09.2016 purporting to apply for documents for appeal purposes was addressed to the Registrar of the High Court (Main Registry). We wish to state at this juncture that even though the letter indicates "(Main Registry)" the same was 3ps. cancelled and against it the words "at Dar es Salaam" were scribbled. No initials were inserted to suggest the scribble words were in were meant to replace the "Main Registry". This adds yet another puzzle as to which court was addressed. 2ps. 1ps. We wish to state at this juncture that even though the letter indicates "(Main Registry)" the same was cancelled and against it the words "at Dar es Salaam" were scribbled. No initials were inserted to suggest the scribble words were in were meant to replace the "Main Registry". This adds yet another puzzle as to which court was addressed. The suit whose decision is sought to 2ps. be challenged was filed in the High Court, Dar es Salaam Zone. Thus, addressing the letter to the Main Registry of the High Court served no useful purpose and this enhances our worries of the respondents not intending to institute the intended appeal.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why was the dispute not relevant to the court it was lodged in?
        answer: |
          The dispute was not related to a land issue, yet the respondents lodged it in the land division of the High Court.
      - question: |
          What does the respondents' handling of the matter suggest about their intentions to appeal?
        answer: |
          The respondents' poor handling of the matter suggests they had no intention to appeal and challenge the decision.
      - question: |
          What inconsistency is noted in the respondents' letter about the address of the court?
        answer: |
          The letter was initially addressed to the 'Main Registry' but was later scribbled by hand to read 'at Dar es Salaam' without any initials to confirm the change, adding uncertainty about which court was addressed.
      - question: |
          Why was addressing the letter to the Main Registry problematic?
        answer: |
          The suit being challenged was filed in the High Court, Dar es Salaam Zone, so addressing the letter to the Main Registry served no useful purpose.
      - question: |
          What document bears Ref. No. AGC/MISC/2016/4/13, and what is its significance?
        answer: |
          The document is a letter dated 21.09.2016, in which the respondents purported to apply for appeal documents, but it exhibited inconsistencies in addressing the correct court.

      1ps. 1ps. From the look of things, we, respectfully, do not think the shortcoming is an excusable keyboard mistake as Ms. Kyamba argued with some considerable force. It is our considered view that the respondents' way of handling the matter at hand leaves a lot to be desired. What explanation is given of lodging in the Land Division of the High Court a notice of appeal which had nothing to do with a 2ps. land matter? Or what made the respondents address the letter to the Registrar of the Main Registry of the High Court while the case was filed, heard and determined by the High Court, Dar es Salaam Zone? When we put these questions to Ms. Kyamba at the hearing, she did not have any plausible explanation. She ultimately surrendered the matter to the wisdom of 3ps. the Court. And to take the matter a little bit further, what prevented the respondents from filing an affidavit in reply in the year 2017 when they were served with the application? 2ps. 1ps. When we put these questions to Ms. Kyamba at the hearing, she did not have any plausible explanation. She ultimately surrendered the matter to the wisdom of the Court. And to take the matter a little bit further, what prevented the respondents from filing an affidavit in reply in the year 2017 when they were served with the application? Surely, we do not think the respondents were 2ps. not deliberately negligent in dealing with the matter at hand. In the circumstances, the authorities relied upon by the respondents; Transcontinental Forwarders Ltd (supra) and Saleh Abdi Mohamed (supra) are distinguishable from the instant case.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What argument did Ms. Kyamba present regarding the shortcoming mentioned in the context?
        answer: |
          Ms. Kyamba argued with considerable force that the shortcoming was an excusable keyboard mistake.
      - question: |
          What irregularities in handling the case are highlighted in the context?
        answer: |
          The irregularities include lodging a notice of appeal in the Land Division of the High Court for a non-land matter and addressing a letter to the Registrar of the Main Registry instead of handling the matter through the correct High Court zone.
      - question: |
          How did Ms. Kyamba respond to the questions posed during the hearing?
        answer: |
          Ms. Kyamba did not have any plausible explanation and ultimately surrendered the matter to the wisdom of the Court.
      - question: |
          Why is it questioned that the respondents did not file an affidavit in reply in 2017?
        answer: |
          The court questions why the respondents failed to file an affidavit in reply in 2017 even though they had been served with the application, suggesting that their inaction might have been deliberate negligence.
      - question: |
          Why were the authorities cited by the respondents considered distinguishable from the instant case?
        answer: |
          The court found the authorities cited by the respondents, Transcontinental Forwarders Ltd and Saleh Abdi Mohamed, to be distinguishable due to the specific circumstances and handling of the current matter.

It is supported by an affidavit deposed by Urban Jeremiah Mtui; the applicant, and resisted by 2ps. an affidavit in reply deposed by Narindwa Sekimanga; a State Attorney in the office of the second respondent. On the one hand, the gist of the applicant's affidavit is that the respondents have not taken essential steps towards the furtherance of the intended appeal in that the notice of appeal and the letter requesting for the documents for appeal purposes are in respect of a non-existent matter; they are not in respect of 3ps.

  **Document Outline:**
  
  The document is a ruling from the Court of Appeal of Tanzania concerning Civil Application No. 265/16 of 2017, where the applicant, Urban J. Mtui, seeks to strike out a notice of appeal filed by the respondents—the Commissioner General of the Tanzania Revenue Authority and the Attorney General—on the grounds of procedural defects and failure to take essential steps for an intended appeal. The case traces back to a High Court decision in favor of Mtui regarding unlawful termination, with the respondents pursuing delayed appeal measures that the applicant challenges as legally deficient.
