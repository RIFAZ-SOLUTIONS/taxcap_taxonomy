         that case from  the  particulars  at hand.  As we  have  already intimated,
         in  the former case, the concern was over a copy of a letter which was
         completely missing  from  the  record.
      Upon  our  mature  consideration,
         we think that this  is  a  case  where the  Court  should  have  due  regard
         to  the
      2ps. need  to  achieve  substantive justice in line with Rule 2 of the Rules as it is
         our well considered view that the shortcomings we have pointed out should not
         lead to the drastic action of  invalidating  the  entire  record  of  appeal.
          Thus,  in  the  spirit  of  the overriding  objectives  of  the  Court  we,
         accordingly,  grant  leave  to  the appellant to lodge the omitted copies of
         written submission  under Rule 96 (6)  within
      3ps. twenty  one  (21)  days  from  the  date  of  this  Ruling.  In  the meantime,
         the two appeals stand adjourned to a date to  be fixed  by the Registrar.
         It is so ordered.
