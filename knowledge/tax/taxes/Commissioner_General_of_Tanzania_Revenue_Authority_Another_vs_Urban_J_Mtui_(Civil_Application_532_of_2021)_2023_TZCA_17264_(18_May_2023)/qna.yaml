Civil Application No. 8 of 2014 (unreported), where it was held: " The discretion o f the Court to extend time under Rule 10 is unfettered, but it has also been held that, in considering an application under the rule, the Court may take into consideration, such factors as, the length o f the delay, the reason for the delay, the chance o f success o f the intended appeal, and the degree o f prejudice that the ## respondent may 3ps. suffer if the application is granted". 3ps. 1ps. It has also to be noted that, extension is an equitable remedy. Therefore, in deciding whether or not to grant it, the court is expected as well to consider the reason for the delay and the degree of prejudice that the respondent may suffer if the application is granted.

I have two reasons to justify my view. First, the case at the trial court was initiated in 2001 when the defunct ICT was still in operation. It was concluded in 2013 when the same had phased out of existence hardly ten years before. In my view, as the law and dispute settlement machineries under which the jurisdictional issue is based are no longer in existence, it is a matter of common 2ps. sense that, the intended correction of illegality is not of sufficient importance. Second and more importantly, this dispute has been pending in courts since 2001. It is now 23 years old. It relates to the fate of the service of the respondent. This means that, throughout this time, the respondent is unemployed. The facts in the affidavits suggest that, while the applicants 3ps. are responsible for this very inordinate delay and sometime by their negligent inaction, the respondent is not. Obviously, therefore, the grant of the application will occasion serious injustice on the part of the respondent It will not serve any meaningful purpose as well. 5ps. 1ps.
