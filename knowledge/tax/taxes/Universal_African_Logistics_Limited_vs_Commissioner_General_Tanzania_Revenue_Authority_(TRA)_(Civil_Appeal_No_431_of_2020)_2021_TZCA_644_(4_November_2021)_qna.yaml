It was Mr. Gugami's further contention that even if the appellant had complied with the requirement under Note (b) (v) of the First Schedule to the VAT Act which was identical to the requirement under Regulation 6 (1) of the VAT Export Regulations, Regulation 6 (2) of the VAT Export Regulations qualifies Regulation 6 (1) by providing that services qualifying for zero-rating are those for which the intermediary receives commission from the principal. Section 7 (4) of the VAT Act defined "place of supply" of services as follows: "(4) 2ps. Services shall be regarded as supplied in Mainland Tanzania if the supplier of the services(a) has a place of business in Mainland Tanzania and no place of business elsewhere; (b) has no place of business in Mainland Tanzania or elsewhere but his usual place of residence is in Mainland Tanzania; or (c) has places of business in Mainland Tanzania and elsewhere but the place of business most concerned with the supply of the services is the place of business 3ps. in Mainland Tanzania." 2ps. 1ps.

It was common ground that paragraph (c) of section 7 (4) above is applicable to the matter at hand in view of the appellant's arrangements and operations at Mwanza as well as with its affiliate, UWA, in the United States.

      1ps. 1ps. Replying, Mr. Gugami agreed that Tanzania applies the destination principle in charging VAT on supplies of goods or services but that the law imposes a restricted or deeming approach with respect to the treatment of exportation and zero-rating of supplies of services to the extent that a service may be consumed or enjoyed outside Tanzania but fail to qualify for treatment as exported supply and hence deemed by law 2ps. to have been destined in Tanzania. That the relevant provision for the present purposes is Note (b) (v) of the First Schedule to the VAT Act as amended by the Finance Act No. 13 of 2008 and Regulation 6 (1) of the VAT Export Regulations both of which are in pari materia. These provisions stipulate that the supply of services rendered by an intermediary acting for another person, shall be treated as 3ps. being exported only when the underlying transaction is supplied outside Tanzania. The phrase "underlying transaction", it was submitted, refers, according to Regulation 2 of the VAT Export Regulations, to principal business, deal or matter. 2ps. 1ps. That the relevant provision for the present purposes is Note (b) (v) of the First Schedule to the VAT Act as amended by the Finance Act No. 13 of 2008 and Regulation 6 (1) of the VAT Export Regulations both of which are in pari materia. These provisions stipulate that the supply of services rendered by an intermediary acting for another person, shall be treated as being exported only when the underlying transaction is 2ps. supplied outside Tanzania. Thus, Mr. Gugami argued that the appellant's principal business of coordinating, organising, arranging, processing and obtaining landing and navigation permits is what constitutes her underlying business as opposed to flying over Africa's airspace as alleged by the appellant's counsel.

      - question: |
          What does the phrase 'underlying transaction' refer to in the context of VAT Export Regulations?

      1ps. 1ps. We further note from Exhibit A-2 that in response to the request for opinion, the respondent confirmed that the proposed transactions fell outside the ambit of the VAT Act and that they would not be vatable. However, we would agree with Mr. Gugami that Exhibit A-l does not mention the appellant as the taxpayer for whom the advice was sought. In the premises, the claim that the 2ps. opinion in issue should not operate against the appellant as a taxpayer on the ground that it was acted upon by the appellant does not arise. It negates the appellant's claim that she relied upon the respondent's opinion given to her to her detriment. Specifically on the question of estoppel, we are unpersuaded by Dr. Mwiburi's submission that the respondent being a statutory organ vested with the power to administer the tax laws should be estopped from denying the commanding adherence or bindingness on 3ps. it of its opinions to taxpayers. 2ps. 1ps. In the premises, the claim that the opinion in issue should not operate against the appellant as a taxpayer on the ground that it was acted upon by the appellant does not arise. It negates the appellant's claim that she relied upon the respondent's opinion given to her to her detriment. It is our respectful view that our decision in Roshani Meghjee {supra) settled the law that there is no estoppel against the performance of a statutory duty. By way of 2ps. emphasis, we wish to extract a quotation from Income Tax Commissioner {supra), which was the basis of our decision in Roshani Meghjee {supra)'.

      1ps. 1ps. The impugned holding reads thus: "We therefore agree with the findings of the Board that the appellant failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove that there was agency relationship (implied) between the appellant and Universal Weather and Aviation. As correctly held by the Board, in normal circumstances if the appellant is the agent of Universal Weather and Aviation it was expected that those invoices were to be sent directly to Universal Weather and Aviation as a principal and in return Universal 2ps. Weather and Aviation had to pay commission to the appellant as his agent but unfortunately this was not the case. "[Emphasis added] Dr. Mwiburi started off arguing that the above holding was a total misapprehension of the facts and the law. Citing sections 138 and 139 of the Law of Contract Act, Cap. 345 R.E. 2002 he contended that the authority of an agent could be either express or implied and that the existence of an 3ps. agency could be proved not just by documentary evidence but it could also be inferred from the conduct of the parties. 2ps. 1ps.
