Having heard the arguments for and against the appeal, and upon carefully examining the record, we find it appropriate to consider the substance of the appeal. From the counsel's concurrent submissions, it would appear to us that this is not the first time this Court is construing the 2ps. clause "service rendered" in section 69(i) (i) of the Act to determine if the income has a source in Tanzania. In the first time, such issue was considered in Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited (supra). In the said case just like in the instant one, the services for whose fees withholding taxes were deducted, were performed outside Tanzania by non-resident persons. In the 3ps. first appeal, the Board treated the payment to have a source in Tanzania for the reason that, the analysis of samples done in the United Kingdom which constituted the service, could not be disassociated with the drilling activity in Tanzania. 2ps. 1ps.

    questions_and_answers:

        answer: |
          The main issue was whether payments for services rendered by non-resident service providers to Mantra (Tanzania) Limited were subject to withholding taxes in Tanzania and whether the rule against double taxation under Article 7 of the Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) between South Africa and Tanzania applied.

        answer: |
          The Tax Appeals Tribunal confirmed the decision of the Tax Appeals Board, which held that the payments for services rendered by non-resident providers were sourced in Tanzania, subject to withholding taxes, and that the rule against double taxation under the DTA was inapplicable to the withholding taxes.

          Which legal principle in the Double Taxation Agreement was argued by the appellant to be relevant in their appeal?
        answer: |

          Why was the rule against double taxation under Article 7 of the DTA found inapplicable in this case?

      1ps. 1ps. In its own words, the Court stated as follows:- "It is our strong view that the word rendered under section 69(i) (i) is synonymous to words "supplied" or n delivered" . In this regard, a non-resident who provides services to a resident, has delivered/ supplied services to a resident of the united Republic of Tanzania. The recipient of the service is actually the payer for such services, in which case, " source of payment" cannot be any other place except where the 2ps. payer resides. In other words as the services of which the payments were made were consumed or utilized in the United Republic of Tanzania, for the purpose of earning income in the United Republic of Tanzania, then the payments made for such services had a source in the United Republic of Tanzania " It is worth of note that, just as it is in the instant case, in the said case, the Court was strongly urged to follow the position in Pan African 3ps. Energy Tanzania Limited (supra). 2ps. 1ps. In this regard, a non-resident who provides services to a resident, has delivered/ supplied services to a resident of the united Republic of Tanzania. The recipient of the service is actually the payer for such services, in which case, " source of payment" cannot be any other place except where the payer resides.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the Court's interpretation of the term 'rendered' under section 69(i)(i)?
        answer: |
          The Court interprets the term 'rendered' as synonymous with 'supplied' or 'delivered,' implying that a non-resident providing services to a resident has effectively supplied or delivered those services to the resident of the United Republic of Tanzania.
      - question: |
          Why does the Court consider the 'source of payment' to be tied to the payer's residence?
        answer: |
          The Court considers the 'source of payment' to be where the payer resides because the services for which payments were made were consumed or utilized in the United Republic of Tanzania, contributing to earning income in the country.
      - question: |
          Why did the Court find the Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited case inapplicable in this context?
        answer: |

      - question: |
          What distinction did the Court draw between the Indian statute and section 69(i)(i)?
        answer: |
          The Court noted that the wording of the Indian statute was substantially different from section 69(i)(i), making the Indian case's reasoning unsuitable for application in the current jurisdiction.

          What is the importance of where services are consumed or utilized according to the Court?
        answer: |
          The Court emphasizes that services consumed or utilized in the United Republic of Tanzania create a connection to the country, making the payments for such services sourced from within Tanzania.
