He argued that the appellant's resort to section 17 (2) of the TRAA was necessitated by the Board's stance raising an issue suo mottu in relation to lack of evidence proving compliance with section 44 (2) of the Act without affording the parties right to be heard on it. Several authorities from decided cases were cited along with Article 13 (6) (a) of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, 1977 to underscore the argument that breach of fundamental right to be heard 2ps. is a fatal irregularity which should have been sufficient to grant leave to admit additional evidence. At any rate, the appellant's advocate argued, the letter sought to be admitted as additional evidence was not new to the respondent as it was part of appellant's notice of objection (exhibit A6) thus, no prejudice could have been occasioned had the Tribunal exercised its discretion in favour of the appellant. 2ps. 1ps.

Act through an application by way of a letter dated 10/07/2011 received by the respondent on 15/07/2011 notifying him of his election under section 44 (2) of the Act (annex JEK-10 to the statement of appeal).

He reiterated his argument that the additional evidence became necessary after the Board had made a decision on it holding that the transfer of ownership of the asset by the appellant to the Company was between associates who had not met the requirements under section 44 (4) (e) of the Act.

Otherwise, it is not clear to us why the appellant could have omitted to annex the letter referred to in exhibit A6 meant to prove that he had made the election under section 44 (2) and complied with section 44 (4) of the Act as indicated in para 2 of exhibit A6. The Tribunal was equally alive to rule 6 (4) on the appellant's avenue to file additional 2ps. documents three days before the date fixed for hearing which he did not utilise. We appreciate the written submissions by the appellant's advocates at para 3.3 and 3.4 to the effect that the prayer for admission of additional evidence became necessary because the Board made a decision on the appellant's compliance with section 44 (2) of the Act which was a departure from the issue as to the 3ps. applicability of that section to the transaction in dispute. We have a genuine and unfeigned respect to the learned advocates but we are not prepared to agree with them. 2ps. 1ps. The Tribunal was equally alive to rule 6 (4) on the appellant's avenue to file additional documents three days before the date fixed for hearing which he did not utilise. We have a genuine and unfeigned respect to the learned advocates but we are not prepared to agree with them. This is because the applicability and compliance with section 44 (2) of the Act are inseparable considering that the appellant's objection by way of 2ps. exhibit A6 hinged on the compliance with the very section upon meeting all the conditions for its application prescribed by section 44 (4) of the Act. That was indeed the appellant's case on which the Board found no evidence of compliance with section 44 (4) (e).

          What was the purpose of the letter referred to in exhibit A6?

      - question: |
          What procedural opportunity did the appellant miss before the hearing?

      - question: |
          What argument was made by the appellant's advocates in their written submissions?
        answer: |
          The appellant's advocates argued in para 3.3 and 3.4 of their submissions that the prayer for admission of additional evidence was necessary because the Board's decision on the appellant's compliance with section 44 (2) of the Act deviated from the issue regarding the applicability of that section to the transaction in dispute.
      - question: |
          Why did the Tribunal reject the appellant's advocates' argument regarding section 44 (2) and section 44 (4)?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal rejected the argument because the applicability of section 44 (2) and compliance with it, as prescribed by section 44 (4), were deemed inseparable. The appellant's case relied on compliance with section 44 (4), but the Board found no evidence of such compliance.
      - question: |
