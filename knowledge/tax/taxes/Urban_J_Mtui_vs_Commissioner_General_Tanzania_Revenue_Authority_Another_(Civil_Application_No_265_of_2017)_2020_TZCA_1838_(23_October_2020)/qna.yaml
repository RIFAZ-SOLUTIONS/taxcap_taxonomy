      1ps. 1ps. This course of action by the respondents baffled us. The dispute between the parties was not at ail related to a land dispute and the parties had never referred their dispute to that court. Why should the respondents have resorted to lodge it in the land division of the High Court? Given the lousy way the respondents handled this matter from the outset compels 2ps. us to agree with Mr. Kariwa that the respondents had no intention to appeal so as to assail the decision. Fourthly, the letter by the respondents bearing Ref. No. AGC/MISC/2016/4/13 dated 21.09.2016 purporting to apply for documents for appeal purposes was addressed to the Registrar of the High Court (Main Registry). We wish to state at this juncture that even though the letter indicates "(Main Registry)" the same was 3ps. cancelled and against it the words "at Dar es Salaam" were scribbled. No initials were inserted to suggest the scribble words were in were meant to replace the "Main Registry". This adds yet another puzzle as to which court was addressed. 2ps. 1ps. We wish to state at this juncture that even though the letter indicates "(Main Registry)" the same was cancelled and against it the words "at Dar es Salaam" were scribbled. No initials were inserted to suggest the scribble words were in were meant to replace the "Main Registry". This adds yet another puzzle as to which court was addressed. The suit whose decision is sought to 2ps. be challenged was filed in the High Court, Dar es Salaam Zone. Thus, addressing the letter to the Main Registry of the High Court served no useful purpose and this enhances our worries of the respondents not intending to institute the intended appeal.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why was it puzzling that the respondents lodged the dispute in the High Court's land division?
        answer: |
          The dispute between the parties was unrelated to a land matter, and the dispute had never been referred to that court, making the choice of the land division of the High Court perplexing.
      - question: |
          What conclusion did the authors reach about the respondents' intention to appeal the decision?
        answer: |
          The authors agreed with Mr. Kariwa that the respondents likely had no intention of filing an appeal to challenge the decision due to the sloppy handling of the matter.
      - question: |
          What irregularity was noted in the letter Ref. No. AGC/MISC/2016/4/13 dated 21.09.2016?
        answer: |
          The letter, initially addressed to the 'Main Registry' of the High Court, had the words 'at Dar es Salaam' scribbled over it without any initials to clarify this alteration, creating confusion about which court was addressed.
      - question: |
          How did addressing the letter to the Main Registry negatively affect the case?
        answer: |
          Since the suit was filed in the High Court, Dar es Salaam Zone, addressing the letter to the Main Registry served no useful purpose and raised doubts about the respondents' seriousness in pursuing the intended appeal.
      - question: |
          What added to the authors' skepticism about the respondents' actions in the case?
        answer: |
          Several inconsistencies, such as the choice of the land division, the ambiguous alterations in the letter, and addressing it to the Main Registry instead of the Dar es Salaam Zone, contributed to their skepticism about the respondents' intentions.

      1ps. 1ps. From the look of things, we, respectfully, do not think the shortcoming is an excusable keyboard mistake as Ms. Kyamba argued with some considerable force. It is our considered view that the respondents' way of handling the matter at hand leaves a lot to be desired. What explanation is given of lodging in the Land Division of the High Court a notice of appeal which had nothing to do with a 2ps. land matter? Or what made the respondents address the letter to the Registrar of the Main Registry of the High Court while the case was filed, heard and determined by the High Court, Dar es Salaam Zone? When we put these questions to Ms. Kyamba at the hearing, she did not have any plausible explanation. She ultimately surrendered the matter to the wisdom of 3ps. the Court. And to take the matter a little bit further, what prevented the respondents from filing an affidavit in reply in the year 2017 when they were served with the application? 2ps. 1ps. When we put these questions to Ms. Kyamba at the hearing, she did not have any plausible explanation. She ultimately surrendered the matter to the wisdom of the Court. And to take the matter a little bit further, what prevented the respondents from filing an affidavit in reply in the year 2017 when they were served with the application? Surely, we do not think the respondents were 2ps. not deliberately negligent in dealing with the matter at hand. In the circumstances, the authorities relied upon by the respondents; Transcontinental Forwarders Ltd (supra) and Saleh Abdi Mohamed (supra) are distinguishable from the instant case.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What was the argument presented by Ms. Kyamba regarding the shortcoming?
        answer: |
          Ms. Kyamba argued with some force that the shortcoming was an excusable keyboard mistake.
      - question: |
          What procedural errors did the respondents commit in handling the case?
        answer: |
          The respondents lodged a notice of appeal in the Land Division of the High Court, unrelated to a land matter, and addressed a letter to the Registrar of the Main Registry instead of the Dar es Salaam Zone where the case was filed, heard, and determined.
      - question: |
          How did Ms. Kyamba respond when questioned about the procedural errors during the hearing?
        answer: |
          Ms. Kyamba did not provide any plausible explanation for the procedural errors and ultimately surrendered the matter to the wisdom of the Court.
      - question: |
          What question remains unanswered regarding the respondents' actions in 2017?
        answer: |
          It remains unclear why the respondents failed to file an affidavit in reply in 2017 when they were served with the application.
      - question: |
          Why are the authorities cited by the respondents considered distinguishable from this case?
        answer: |
          The authorities, Transcontinental Forwarders Ltd and Saleh Abdi Mohamed, are distinguishable from the instant case because the respondents were found to be deliberately negligent in handling the matter.
