          The appellant appealed against the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal, which upheld the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board requiring payment of taxes and penalties for the years of income from 2001 to 2004.
      - question: |
          When was the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal delivered?
        answer: |
          The decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal was delivered on 10th November 2017.
  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. The Tribunal agreed with the finding of the Board. However, despite the fact that the Tribunal observed that it agreed with the Board on its reasoning and verdict, we are afraid, the verdict of the Tribunal and the Board's were the same but not the reasoning thereof. To unveil the somewhat contradiction by the Board and Tribunal in their reference to the 2ps. same paragraph and sub-section (1) of section 34, we find it apt to reproduce section 34 (1) (c) of the Income Tax Act, 1973, which was applicable then. It reads: "34.-(1) Every person shall ' upon payment of any amount to any non-resident person not having a permanent establishment in the United Republic in respect of- - (a) any management or professional fee; ## (b) any royalty; ## (c) any rent, premium or like consideration for the use or occupation of 3ps. property; - (d) any dividend; - (e) any interest; or (f) any pension or retirement annuity, which is chargeable to tax, deduct therefrom tax at the appropriate non-resident withholding tax rate." ## [Emphasis supplied]. 2ps. 1ps. We say so because, while the Board held that the payment made by the appellant to M/S Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd for purchase of computer software is taxable in terms of section 34 (1) (c) of the Income Tax Act, 1973, that is, as "any rent, premium or like consideration for the use or occupation of property", the Tribunal held that the same was taxable under, purportedly, the same section 2ps. 34 (1) (c) of the Income Tax Act, 1973, as "royalty". After a close look at the provisions of the law referred to, we think, the Board and the Tribunal used different vehicles to arrive at the same destination.

      - question: |
          What section of the Income Tax Act, 1973 is primarily referenced in the context?
        answer: |
          Section 34 (1) (c) of the Income Tax Act, 1973 is primarily referenced.
      - question: |

        answer: |
          The Board held that the payment was taxable as 'rent, premium or like consideration for the use or occupation of property,' while the Tribunal held it was taxable as 'royalty,' both under section 34 (1) (c).
      - question: |
          What types of payments does section 34 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1973 require tax deduction for?
        answer: |
          Section 34 (1) requires tax deduction for payments to non-residents in respect of management or professional fees, royalties, rent, dividends, interest, and pensions or retirement annuities that are chargeable to tax.
      - question: |
          What contradiction is mentioned between the Tribunal and the Board’s decision?
        answer: |
          The contradiction lies in their reasoning: both agreed the payment was taxable under section 34 (1) (c), but they classified it differently – as 'rent' (Board) versus 'royalty' (Tribunal).
      - question: |
          What example of a payment was at the center of this decision involving section 34 (1) (c)?
        answer: |
          The payment in question was made by the appellant to M/S Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd for the purchase of computer software.
  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. It held that the respondent was entitled to withholding tax for payments she made to her supplier for the software licence. Aggrieved, the appellant appealed to the Tribunal which, though for somewhat different reasons, upheld the decision of the Board. At the hearing of the appeal before us, the appellant appeared through Mr. Yohanes Konda and Dr. Erasmo Nyika, learned 2ps. advocates. On the other hand, Mr. Juma Kisongo, learned Principal State Attorney, assisted by Messrs. Harold Gugami and Marcel Busegano, learned Senior State Attorneys, joined forces to represent the respondent. Both parties had earlier on filed written submissions in support of their respective positions which they successfully sought to adopt as part of their oral arguments 3ps. before us. It was Dr. Nyika who submitted for the appellant. He argued grounds 1, 3 and 4 conjointly and the remaining grounds 2 and 5 were argued separately. 2ps. 1ps. Both parties had earlier on filed written submissions in support of their respective positions which they successfully sought to adopt as part of their oral arguments before us. It was Dr. Nyika who submitted for the appellant. He argued grounds 1, 3 and 4 conjointly and the remaining grounds 2 and 5 were argued separately. The essence of 2ps. the appellant's arguments on grounds 1 , 3 and 4 in the written submissions and the oral arguments by Dr. Nyika before us, is that it was an error for the Tribunal to hold that payment for the right to use software constitutes royalty and thus subject to withholding tax. It is the appellant's contention that the Tribunal wrongly 3ps. interpreted the term "royalty" under section 2 of the Income Tax Act, 1973. Dr.

  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. We think the Tribunal used the 2002 Revised Edition of the Income Tax Act while the Board used the Income Tax Act, 1973 as it was before the Revised Edition of 2002. For easy reference, we reproduce the 2002 version of the Income Tax Act. It reads: "34. Thus, the "any rent, premium or like consideration for the use or occupation of property" used by the Board to hold that the payment made by the appellant to M/S 2ps. Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd was taxable, appears in para (d) of the 2002 Revised Edition whereas it appears in para (c) in the 1973 version. Be that as it may, both the Board and the Tribunal arrived at the same conclusion that payment made by the appellant to M/S Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd was taxable. The appeal before us is against the decision 3ps. of the Tribunal which held that the payment was taxable as royalty in terms of section 34 (1) (c) of the Income Tax Act, Cap. 2ps. 1ps. Thus, the "any rent, premium or like consideration for the use or occupation of property" used by the Board to hold that the payment made by the appellant to M/S Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd was taxable, appears in para (d) of the 2002 Revised Edition whereas it appears in para (c) in the 1973 version. Be that as it may, both the Board and the Tribunal arrived at the same conclusion that 2ps. payment made by the appellant to M/S Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd was taxable. 332 of the Revised Edition, 2002.

        answer: |

  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. That, in our view, is a hallmark of a royalty subject to withholding tax and the Tribunal was justified to so hold. And, as if clinch the matter, the clause is similar with such clauses in Celtel Tanzania Ltd (supra) and National Microfinance Bank Tanzania Limited (supra). Guided by the position we took in Celtel Tanzania Ltd (supra) and National Microfinance Bank Tanzania Limited 2ps. (supra), we do not see any legal justification to depart from that position. We are not persuaded by the argument advanced by Dr. Nyika that Celtel Tanzania Ltd (supra) is distinguishable, for the obvious reason that we took the same view in National Microfinance Bank Tanzania Limited (supra) without even referring to Celtel Tanzania Ltd (supra) which Dr. Nyika would have 3ps. us hold is distinguishable. We are of the settled view in our mind that the two cases depict a correct position of the law in this jurisdiction and thus see no sound legal reason why we should depart from that sound standpoint. 2ps. 1ps. Guided by the position we took in Celtel Tanzania Ltd (supra) and National Microfinance Bank Tanzania Limited (supra), we do not see any legal justification to depart from that position.
