          The appellant was required to tender relevant evidence at the stage when the dispute was referred on appeal to the TRAB.

      1ps. 1ps. In its decision, the TRAT agreed with the counsel for the respondent that the appellant failed to produce the required evidence to substantiate her claim. The TRAT emphasized that the appellant could have provided that evidence during the audit stage, during the objection or during the hearing of the case at the level of the TRAB.

For purpose of clarity, we better reproduce the relevant submission of Mr. Kibuta, the appellant's counsel in respect of this issue: "Issue number six also related in the income year 2008 which inventoty costs were disallowed in deduction. There are no clear reasons provided by TRA for disallowing the inventory costs. And the failure to state the reasons for disallowing is on itself an act of arbitrary. 2ps. 1ps. For purpose of clarity, we better reproduce the relevant submission of Mr. Kibuta, the appellant's counsel in respect of this issue: "Issue number six also related in the income year 2008 which inventoty costs were disallowed in deduction. There are no clear reasons provided by TRA for disallowing the inventory costs. And the failure to state the reasons for disallowing is on itself an act of arbitrary. There is a second reason why you should find in favour of the tax payer in this point. In making the transfer pricing adjustment the 2ps. cosb of inventory is automatically adjusted. When you disallow the costs of inventory separately you are doing a double disallowance which is not proper in accounting perspective.
