It was Mr. Gugami's further contention that even if the appellant had complied with the requirement under Note (b) (v) of the First Schedule to the VAT Act which was identical to the requirement under Regulation 6 (1) of the VAT Export Regulations, Regulation 6 (2) of the VAT Export Regulations qualifies Regulation 6 (1) by providing that services qualifying for zero-rating are those for which the intermediary receives commission from the principal.

Replying, Mr. Gugami agreed that Tanzania applies the destination principle in charging VAT on supplies of goods or services but that the law imposes a restricted or deeming approach with respect to the treatment of exportation and zero-rating of supplies of services to the extent that a service may be consumed or enjoyed outside Tanzania but fail to qualify for treatment as exported supply and hence deemed by law 2ps. to have been destined in Tanzania. That the relevant provision for the present purposes is Note (b) (v) of the First Schedule to the VAT Act as amended by the Finance Act No. 13 of 2008 and Regulation 6 (1) of the VAT Export Regulations both of which are in pari materia. These provisions stipulate that the supply of services rendered by an intermediary acting for another person, shall be treated as 3ps. being exported only when the underlying transaction is supplied outside Tanzania.

      1ps. 1ps. We further note from Exhibit A-2 that in response to the request for opinion, the respondent confirmed that the proposed transactions fell outside the ambit of the VAT Act and that they would not be vatable. However, we would agree with Mr. Gugami that Exhibit A-l does not mention the appellant as the taxpayer for whom the advice was sought. In the premises, the claim that the 2ps. opinion in issue should not operate against the appellant as a taxpayer on the ground that it was acted upon by the appellant does not arise. It negates the appellant's claim that she relied upon the respondent's opinion given to her to her detriment. Specifically on the question of estoppel, we are unpersuaded by Dr. Mwiburi's submission that the respondent being a statutory organ vested with the power to administer the tax laws should be estopped from denying the commanding adherence or bindingness on 3ps. it of its opinions to taxpayers. 2ps. 1ps. In the premises, the claim that the opinion in issue should not operate against the appellant as a taxpayer on the ground that it was acted upon by the appellant does not arise. It negates the appellant's claim that she relied upon the respondent's opinion given to her to her detriment. It is our respectful view that our decision in Roshani Meghjee {supra) settled the law that there is no estoppel against the performance of a statutory duty.

Weather and Aviation had to pay commission to the appellant as his agent but unfortunately this was not the case.

Citing sections 138 and 139 of the Law of Contract Act, Cap. 345 R.E. 2002 he contended that the authority of an agent could be either express or implied and that the existence of an 3ps. agency could be proved not just by documentary evidence but it could also be inferred from the conduct of the parties. 2ps. 1ps.
