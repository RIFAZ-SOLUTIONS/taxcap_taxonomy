The major condition relevant to the facts of this case is that the remission on the fuel is only valid as long as there is no transfer, sale or disposition of the said fuel in any way to a person other than those entitled to the exemption.

So much for the matters of common ground. It was contended by the appellant that its mode of operation involves use of various contractors to perform its mining activities and that to these contractors the appellant has an obligation, specified under the contracts, to supply inputs, including fuels and lubricants. It is on the above background that the appellant found surprising and unjustified the respondent's series of demands for payment of 2ps. the said TZS. 2,039,696,116.00 in total.

      1ps. 1ps. To start, Mr. Mukebezi proposed to deal with the three grounds of appeal by addressing the following issues; - 1. Whether the Tribunal was correct in law in holding that among the conditions set out in GN. No. 218 of 2009 and GN No. 268 of 2010 as amended by GN. No. 190 of 2010 and GN. No. 191 of 2011 2ps. respectively, for a mining company to enjoy fuel exemption under the Mining Development Agreement with the Government of Tanzania the fuel must be used solely by a mining company in its mining activities; - 2. Whether the Tribunal was correct in law in holding that as long as the contractors were not enjoying similar privileges as those granted to the mining company, the mining company's act of allowing the fuel to be 3ps. used by the contractors cannot be tax exempt as that would run contrary to the condition that the exemption would cease the moment any disposition is made to a non- exempt and; - 3. Whether the Tribunal was correct in law in holding that the respondent's act of demanding excise duty and fuel levy on fuel given to appellant's contractors is lawful and justiciable. 2ps. 1ps. No. 218 of 2009 and GN No. 268 of 2010 as amended by GN. No. 190 of 2010 and GN. The learned counsel submitted as regards the first issue, that the appellant and the contractors are exempted by Article 6 of the MDA from paying taxes on materials or goods imported solely for the mining, so the conclusion by the Tribunal that the validity of 2ps. the exemption ceases when the user of the fuel is not the mining company itself, is wrong.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What were the three key legal issues addressed by Mr. Mukebezi in the appeal?
        answer: |
          The issues were: 1) Whether fuel must be used solely by a mining company to qualify for tax exemption, 2) Whether allowing contractors to use the mining companyâ€™s tax-exempt fuel disqualifies the exemption, and 3) Whether the demand for excise duty and fuel levy on fuel given to contractors is lawful.
      - question: |
          What condition regarding fuel usage did the Tribunal hold as a requirement for tax exemption under the Mining Development Agreement?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal held that for a mining company to qualify for fuel tax exemption, the fuel must be used solely by the mining company in its mining activities.
      - question: |
          What was the Tribunal's reasoning for ruling against exemptions related to fuel used by contractors?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal reasoned that if the fuel was used by contractors who do not enjoy the same tax privileges as the mining company, then the tax exemption ceases as it runs contrary to the conditions of the exemption.
      - question: |
          According to the learned counsel, what does Article 6 of the MDA state regarding tax exemptions?
        answer: |
          Article 6 of the MDA states that both the appellant (mining company) and its contractors are exempted from paying taxes on materials or goods imported solely for mining purposes.
      - question: |
          Why did the learned counsel argue that the Tribunal's decision on the first issue was incorrect?
        answer: |
          The counsel argued that the Tribunalâ€™s conclusion was wrong because Article 6 of the MDA exempts both the mining company and its contractors, meaning the exemption should not cease based on who uses the fuel, as long as it is for mining purposes.

      1ps. 1ps. We think departing from an earlier decision should be more solemn and justified than it is in this case. Even the Rules of this Court make it clear that when a party intends to suggest a departure by the Court from its earlier decision, such intention must be reflected in the Written Submissions and special attention to it must be drawn. That is Rule 106 (3) of the Tanzania Court 2ps. of Appeal Rules, 2009, as amended. It provides; "If the parties intend to invite the Court to depart from one of its earlier decisions, this shall be clearly stated in a separate paragraph of the submissions to which special attention shall be drawn, and the intention shall also be restated as one of the reasons". In the recent amendment to the Rules made by Government Notice No. 344 of 2019, published on 26 April 2019, this provision has been reÂ­ enacted as 3ps. sub Rule (4). 2ps. 1ps.

It provides; "If the parties intend to invite the Court to depart from one of its earlier decisions, this shall be clearly stated in a separate paragraph of the submissions to which special attention shall be drawn, and the intention shall also be restated as one of the reasons". But even assuming that the omission to indicate in the 2ps. written submission would not render the prayer invalid, we are not persuaded that there are grounds for departing from the said earlier decisions of the Court. 3ps. 1ps.

          What does Rule 106(3) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 2009 as amended require when a party intends to suggest a departure from an earlier decision?
        answer: |
          Rule 106(3) requires that the intention to suggest a departure be clearly stated in a separate paragraph of the written submissions, special attention must be drawn to it, and it must be restated as one of the reasons in the argument.
      - question: |
          What is the significance of the recent amendment to the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules by Government Notice No. 344 of 2019?

          What is the Court's view on departing from an earlier decision?
        answer: |

      - question: |
          What happens if a party fails to indicate in their written submissions the intention to invite the Court to depart from an earlier decision?
        answer: |
          While failure to indicate this intention may not render the request invalid, the Court may still be unconvinced or unpersuaded to depart from the earlier decisions.
      - question: |
          Why does the Court emphasize the procedural requirements for suggesting a departure from precedent?
        answer: |
