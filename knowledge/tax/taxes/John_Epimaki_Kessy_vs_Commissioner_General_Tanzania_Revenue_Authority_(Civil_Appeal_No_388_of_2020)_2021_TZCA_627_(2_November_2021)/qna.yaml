He argued that the appellant's resort to section 17 (2) of the TRAA was necessitated by the Board's stance raising an issue suo mottu in relation to lack of evidence proving compliance with section 44 (2) of the Act without affording the parties right to be heard on it.

        answer: |
          The appellant used a letter marked as JEK-10 to support his request for additional evidence.
      - question: |
          Why did the Tribunal deny the appellant's request for leave to admit additional evidence?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal denied the appellant's request because he failed to meet the conditions precedent for the admission of additional evidence, and his request was deemed an afterthought meant to fill gaps in his earlier evidence.

        answer: |
          The Tribunal believed the request for additional evidence was an afterthought and not a legitimate effort, implying it could not substantially or fairly affect the appeal process.

        answer: |
          The first ground of appeal was that the Tribunal failed to exercise its discretion judiciously in refusing to admit additional evidence pursuant to section 17 (2) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act.

      1ps. 1ps. Otherwise, it is not clear to us why the appellant could have omitted to annex the letter referred to in exhibit A6 meant to prove that he had made the election under section 44 (2) and complied with section 44 (4) of the Act as indicated in para 2 of exhibit A6. The Tribunal was equally alive to rule 6 (4) on the appellant's avenue to file additional 2ps. documents three days before the date fixed for hearing which he did not utilise. We appreciate the written submissions by the appellant's advocates at para 3.3 and 3.4 to the effect that the prayer for admission of additional evidence became necessary because the Board made a decision on the appellant's compliance with section 44 (2) of the Act which was a departure from the issue as to the 3ps. applicability of that section to the transaction in dispute. We have a genuine and unfeigned respect to the learned advocates but we are not prepared to agree with them. 2ps. 1ps. The Tribunal was equally alive to rule 6 (4) on the appellant's avenue to file additional documents three days before the date fixed for hearing which he did not utilise. We have a genuine and unfeigned respect to the learned advocates but we are not prepared to agree with them. This is because the applicability and compliance with section 44 (2) of the Act are inseparable considering that the appellant's objection by way of 2ps. exhibit A6 hinged on the compliance with the very section upon meeting all the conditions for its application prescribed by section 44 (4) of the Act. That was indeed the appellant's case on which the Board found no evidence of compliance with section 44 (4) (e).
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What was the purpose of the letter referred to in exhibit A6?
        answer: |
          The letter referred to in exhibit A6 was meant to prove that the appellant had made the election under section 44 (2) and complied with section 44 (4) of the Act.
      - question: |
          Why did the Tribunal highlight rule 6 (4), and what action did the appellant fail to take?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal highlighted rule 6 (4) because it allowed the appellant to file additional documents three days before the hearing, but the appellant did not utilize this opportunity.
      - question: |
          What reasoning did the Tribunal provide for rejecting the appellant’s prayer for the admission of additional evidence?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal rejected the prayer because the appellant’s case hinged on compliance with section 44 (4), and no evidence was provided to demonstrate compliance with this section, which was critical for the applicability of section 44 (2).
      - question: |
          What issue did the appellant raise in the written submissions at paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4?
        answer: |
          The appellant argued that the prayer for admission of additional evidence became necessary because the Board's decision on compliance with section 44 (2) was a departure from the issue of the section's applicability to the disputed transaction.
      - question: |
          What stance did the Tribunal take regarding the arguments made by the appellant's advocates?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal acknowledged respect for the appellant’s advocates but did not agree with their arguments, as the applicability and compliance with section 44 (2) were considered inseparable, and no evidence of compliance with section 44 (4) (e) was found.
