      ## Benefits
      
      The Single Window concept examines regulatory  controls  through 
         the  eyes  of  the trader and views all interactions between trade and
         regulatory agencies without regard for the internal division within the
         government  (Paperless  One-gate  One  Stop).  This  approach  benefits  both
          the  government and  traders  as  it  clearly  brings  out  all  the
         procedural  redundancies,  duplication  in  the filing of information and
         wastefulness involved in  the  overall  effort  in 
      
      2ps. fulfilling  cross-border transactions.  It is a trade and logistiical web based
         infrastructure that will be implemented throgh TANCIS.
