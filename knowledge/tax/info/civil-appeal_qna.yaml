Nonetheless, when we requested him to show where such a finding appears in the judgment of the Tribunal, 2ps. Mr. Axwesso was quick to admit that the same is not in the judgment.

It was submitted further or in the alternative that if, which is not, the AMT was imposed basing on 2012 amendment, the decision of the Tribunal would remain correct because ATM was charged on the appellant's turnovers for 2012 and 2013 years of income. The unrelieved perpetual loss for the previous two years of income, he submitted, was only the precondition for the imposition of the same. In the alternative, it was submitted that, under the express provision of section 18 (2) (b) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, [ Cap. 2ps. 408 R.E. 2019] the burden of proof lies on the appellant.
