      1ps. 1ps. Upon taking floor, Mr. Wilson Mukebezi faulted the course taken by the Tribunal. He submitted that, before proceeding to make any determination on the appeal, the Tribunal could have remitted the case file to the trial Board for it to make a decision on the undetermined matter. In this regard, he implored on the Court to return the case file to the Tribunal and direct it to determine the remaining fifth ground of appeal. The learned 2ps. counsel viewed this as the best option to remedy the matter under scrutiny. On the other hand, initially, the learned counsel for the respondent were not comfortable with the course advanced by Mr. Mukebezi. Apart from conceding that it was not proper for the Tribunal to remit the matter to the Board, they were of the view that, it is still open for the Court to dispose of the appeal before it. 2ps. 1ps.
