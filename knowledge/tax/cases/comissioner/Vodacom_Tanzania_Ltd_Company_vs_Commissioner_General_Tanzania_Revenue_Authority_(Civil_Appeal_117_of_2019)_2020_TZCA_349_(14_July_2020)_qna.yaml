Harold Gugami, Marcel Busegano, Juma Kisongo and Hospis Maswanyia, all learned State Attorneys from the respondent's office.

She added that, although the appellant made written correspondences on the matter, that was not acknowledged by the 3ps. Registrar. 2ps. 1ps.

      We  also  find  that,  the  appellant's  counsel  shares  the  blame  in what
         has befallen this  appeal.  We say so  because after being  supplied with the
          requisite documents  by the  Registrar,  she took no action  and remained
         with the irregular documents for 55 days which was close to expiry of the 
         period  within  which  to  lodge  an  appeal,  without  seeking the 
         indulgence  of the  Registrar  to  have 
      
      2ps. the  documents  rectified.   This was  not  a  demonstration  of  diligence  on 
         the  part  of  the  appellant's counsel. 
      
      In  view  of what we  have
         endeavored to demonstrate there is no gainsaying  that the appeal  is  time 
         barred  and  we  accordingly  strike  it out.   We make  no order as to costs
         since the anomaly has  been  raised by the Court suo motu.
