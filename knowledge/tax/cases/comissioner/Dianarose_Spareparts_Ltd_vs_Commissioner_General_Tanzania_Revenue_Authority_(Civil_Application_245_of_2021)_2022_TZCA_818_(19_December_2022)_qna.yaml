In reply Mr. Leyan Sabore learned counsel appearing for the respondent was diametrically opposed to Mr. Wawa's contention regarding indisposition of the proprietor of the secretarial bureau.

      1ps. 1ps. It is as well common ground that, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to the question as to what in law, constitutes good cause. It is for that reason that in the case of Seif Store Limited (supra), we stated that: "The interpretation of what constitutes good cause is entirely left to the discretion of the court, a subjective approach. However, categories of what constitutes a good cause are never dosed." The ill-defined nature of what constitutes "good cause" for purposes 2ps. of extension of time is also reflected in our decision in the case of Geita Gold Mining Limited V. Twalib Ally Civil Application No. 14 of 2012 (unreported) to which we were referred by Mr. Wawa. Given the nature of the facts and circumstances obtaining in that case, we held that: "Good cause may debatably be inferred from the fact that the applicant has a statutory right of appeal whose enjoyment it has promptly begun to process." 2ps. 1ps. However, categories of what constitutes a good cause are never dosed." The ill-defined nature of what constitutes "good cause" for purposes of extension of time is also reflected in our decision in the case of Geita Gold Mining Limited V. Twalib Ally Civil Application No. 14 of 2012 (unreported) to which we were referred by Mr. Wawa. Going by the above-cited authorities and many others, it stands to reason that in application for extension of time, good cause depends on facts and 2ps. circumstances of each case.

      1ps. 1ps. Like in the last cited case, I think that in the instant case, Mr. Wawa who is the applicant's advocate cannot purport to depose on another person's alleged illness and recovery from covid-19 without any supporting evidence by way of deposition from that person. Nor can I accept Mr. Wawa's flimsy explanation that the said person had refused to swear an affidavit in support of the claim of her alleged indisposition. With regard to the allegation that the intended appeal raises 2ps. some important points of law and that the decision by the TRAT is fraught with some material irregularities, I am not satisfied that, that is the case, if truth be told. With due respect, I think the contention that the TRAT decision is fraught with some material irregularities, being the applicant's last remaining holdouts, was added to the application 3ps. as an afterthought. 2ps. 1ps. I therefore take it that the claim that the person who was entrusted to photocopy the documents forming the record of appeal got sick as not to be able to make the copies in time, was not established by evidence. With regard to the allegation that the intended appeal raises some important points of law and that the decision by the TRAT is fraught with some material irregularities, I am 2ps. not satisfied that, that is the case, if truth be told. This is because, as I see it and as correctly submitted by Mr. Sabore, there is nothing suggesting, albeit prima facie' that the decision made by the TRAT is suffering from any material irregularity or that the intended appeal raises any important question of law worth of determination by this Court. This, in my respectful view, is an assertion which may 3ps.

      - question: |
          Why did the court reject Mr. Wawa's explanation regarding the affidavit?

          What was the court's stance on the claim that the decision by the TRAT had material irregularities?
