It was the appellant's submission that, in terms of section 25 (2) of the Interpretation of Laws Act [CAP 1 RE.2002], notes form 2ps. part of the written law and are internal aid to construction of statutes as they serve as explanatory to the provisions of the law. In this regard, it was the appellant's contention that, notes appearing under item 8 in the second schedule can be invoked in the statutory interpretation as internal aid to construction. On the part of the respondent, apart from intimating 3ps. that notes are part of written law in terms of section 25 (2) of Cap 1, she reiterated that land and buildings cannot be separated and that item 8 in the second schedule does not give an elaborate description of what land or part of it when sold is VAT exempted. 2ps. 1ps. It was further amplified that it is common to find such notes in statutes which give clarity on the provisions of the law. In this regard, it was the appellant's contention that, notes appearing under item 8 in the second schedule can be invoked in the statutory interpretation as internal aid to construction. Having carefully considered the submission of learned counsel 2ps. for either parties it is not in dispute that the respondent sold the land in question together with buildings thereon and paid capital gain tax on the two plots and VAT.

      1ps. 1ps. The appellant seems to suggest that the liability of the respondent to pay additional VAT is founded on such 'notes'. Any tax imposed on a subject is dictated by the terms of legislation and a taxing authority must satisfy itself that the transaction fits within the definition of the statute. Our answer is in the negative because, such 'notes' in 2ps. suggesting another category of VAT taxable supply, overrides and enlarges the scope of the legislation and it is not compatible with the dictates of section 10 (1) of the VAT Act, which strictly requires only exempt supplies required to be mentioned in the second schedule. In a nutshell, section 10 (1), items 8 (1), (2) and notes read together have created an ambiguity on the tax liability of the respondent in respect of the buildings on the sold 3ps. plot in question. We are fortified in that account because the subject is not to be taxed unless the words of taxing statute unambiguously impose the tax upon him. 2ps. 1ps.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What does the appellant suggest about the respondent's liability regarding additional VAT?
        answer: |
          The appellant suggests that the respondent's liability to pay additional VAT is based on certain 'notes,' which purportedly identify another VAT-taxable category of supply.
      - question: |
          How does the court view the use of 'notes' to justify additional VAT liability?
        answer: |
          The court rejects the use of 'notes' suggesting an extended VAT-taxable category, stating that they override and enlarge the scope of the legislation, which is incompatible with section 10(1) of the VAT Act.
      - question: |
          What requirement does section 10(1) of the VAT Act impose concerning exempt supplies?
        answer: |

        answer: |
          The court cites the dictum of Lord Simonds in RUSSELL (INSPECTOR OF TAXES) VS SCOTT [1948] 2 ALL ER 5, as referenced in REPUBLIC VS KENYA REVENUE AUTHORITY EX PARTE COOPER KBRANDS LIMITED [2016] e KLR, which emphasizes that a subject should not be taxed unless the statute unambiguously imposes it.

It follows that the respondent acted lawful when demanded for additional VAT on the sale of the land and building, hence additional assessment 2ps. issued was proper."
