      1ps. 1ps. Most unfortunately, this decision was not brought to the attention of the Court by the learned counsel for the parties at the hearing of the instant appeal, though the same counsel for the appellant acted for NMB. Apparently, in NMB {supra) reference was also made to the decision of the Court in Shell Deep Water Tanzania Bv {supra). That being the position' , we find no cause to embrace the appellant's 2ps. invitation to us to depart from the decision in Tullow. We note that, of recent, a corresponding stance was adopted by the Court in the unreported Civil Appeal No. 123 of 2018 Shell Deep Water Tanzania Bv. v. Commissioner General (TRA)." Similarly, in the instant appeal, having regard to factual setting in the record of appeal on the dispute between the parties and the settled position of the law on the interpretation 3ps. of the respective provisions of the ITA stated above, we reaffirm the holding that the decision in Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited {supra) was correctly distinguished in Tullow Tanzania Bv {supra). 2ps. 1ps. We note that, of recent, a corresponding stance was adopted by the Court in the unreported Civil Appeal No. 123 of 2018 Shell Deep Water Tanzania Bv. v. Commissioner General (TRA)." In the circumstances, we respectfully decline the invitation of the appellant's counsel to hold that the decision in Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited {supra) applies to the circumstances of the instant appeal. We do not also 2ps. think that the interpretation of the respective words proposed by the appellant's counsel as described in the referred dictionaries can apply in the circumstances of this appeal in view of the decision in Tullow Tanzania Bv {supra).

  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. While the Indian Act talks of the source of income, on the other hand section 69 (i) (i) talks of source of payment The case of Pan African Energy (supra) is therefore distinguishable as it relied on the interpretation of section 9(1) (vii) c) of the Indian Income Tax Act to arrive at a finding that the said provision, as it was, was in parimateria with section 69(i) (ii) of the Act." Particularly, in the latter decision, 2ps. the Court expressed its concurrence with the decision in Tullow Tanzania Bv {supra) when it stated thus: - "We firmly subscribe to the position held by this Court as expounded in Tullow Tanzania Bv case (supra) a position also adopted in Shell Deep Water Tanzania Bv (supra) on the issue o f"the source" and "services rendered" and also where it was stated that as the recipient of the service is the actual payer for such service, the "source payment" has 3ps. to be where the payer resides." 2ps. 1ps. We have deliberately extensively reproduced the reasoning and holding of the Court in Tullow Tanzania Bv {supra) in order to appreciate the substance of the position of the law as expounded concerning the interpretation of the complained of respective provisions of the ITA. It is thus not surprising, in our view that, as the dispute between the parties was on the interpretation of the complained of provisions, 2ps. the decision of the TRAT, the subject of this appeal was greatly and correctly influenced by the decision of the Court in Tullow Tanzania Bv {supra).

      - question: |
          How does the Pan African Energy case differ from the interpretation in this context?
        answer: |
          The Pan African Energy case is distinguishable because it relied on section 9(1)(vii)(c) of the Indian Income Tax Act, which was comparable to section 69(i)(ii) of the Act, but had a different interpretation of 'source of payment.'
      - question: |
          Why did the Court reproduce the reasoning from the Tullow Tanzania Bv case extensively?

Thirdly, the appellant had obligation to withhold tax for payments made to its non­ residents service providers or suppliers in respect of service rendered to its non-resident service providers or suppliers outside Tanzania but utilized in Tanzania. It is worth pointing out that at the hearing, the appellant's 2ps. counsel argued the appeal generally much as, essentially, the epicenter of the complaints in both grounds of appeal rest on the alleged wrong interpretation by the TRAT of the provisions of section 69 (i) (ii) read together with sections 6 (1) (b) and 83 (1) (b) of the Income Tax Act, (the ITA) which resulted in the alleged erroneous finding with regard to payment of withholding tax. 2ps. 1ps. Thirdly, the appellant had obligation to withhold tax for payments made to its non­ residents service providers or suppliers in respect of service rendered to its non-resident service providers or suppliers outside Tanzania but utilized in Tanzania.

In the premises, relying on those definitions, he submitted that the phrase "rendering services in the United Republic of Tanzania will plainly mean to render service inside or within Tanzania whereas "rendering services to a resident of Tanzania", will plainly mean to render service directed to or to which the destination is Tanzania. In his submission, therefore, the two words do not mean the same thing. Moreover, in his view, 2ps. the reliance by the Court on its decision in Barrick Gold PLC (supra) was equally wrong because there was no tax avoidance scheme to influence the Court to observe that there was a modern approach in interpretation of tax statutes. In essence, he emphasized that in Tullow Tanzania Bv (supra), the main issue which the Court had to consider and determine was whether the appellant was 3ps. required to withhold tax for payments it made to its non-resident consultants for the services rendered off shore as far as section 69(i) (ii) of the ITA is concerned. 2ps. 1ps. Fourthly, the reliance by the Court on the decision of BP Tanzania Limited {supra) was plainly wrong because in that appeal, the Court dealt with the interpretation of the provisions of section 69 (e), while in Tuliow Tanzania Bv {supra) the decision revolved on the interpretation of section 69 (i) (ii) of the ITA which provisions have different objectives. In the end, pressing reliance on the decision of the 2ps. Court in Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited (supra) he urged us to allow the appeal with costs. On the adversary side, the attendance of the respondent was duly expressed by the presence of Ms. Gloria Achimpota, learned Senior State Attorney assisted by Mr. Noa Tito, M r. Harold Gugami and M r. Marcel Busegano, all learned State Attorneys.

      - question: |
          Why was the reliance on the Barrick Gold PLC decision considered wrong in this submission?

          What was the key issue in the Tullow Tanzania Bv case as it related to withholding tax?
