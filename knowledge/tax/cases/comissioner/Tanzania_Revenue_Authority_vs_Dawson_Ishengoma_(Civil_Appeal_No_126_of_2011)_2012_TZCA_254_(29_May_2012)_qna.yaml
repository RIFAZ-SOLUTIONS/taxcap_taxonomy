The letter which was written to the marine police is dated 14.08.1991. The letter was copied to the respondent. We agree with the learned counsel for the appellant and indeed we are settled in our minds that 14.08.1991 is the date that the cause of action arose. From 2ps. 14.08.1991 till 30.12.1999 when the suit was filed is over 8 years. The suit was late by 5 years. The learned trial judge ought to have dismissed the suit for having been filed outside the time limited by law. Even if, for the sake of academic argument we were to assume that the suit was founded on contract, the cause of action would have accrued from 3ps. the date that the RCSTO undertook to repair the vessel which must have been in August 1991 when the respondent found his vessel to have been in a dilapidated state. Counting from August 1991 to December 1999 is a period of over 8 years. 2ps. 1ps. The learned trial judge ought to have dismissed the suit for having been filed outside the time limited by law.
