      1ps. 1ps. In his view, let the dictates of section 53(2) of the Application of Laws Act prevail, which makes it mandatory because the word used is "shall" as in this case. It was his argument further that the notice of revision is important to the extent that an application cannot lie to the Court of Appeal without a notice of intention to appeal. Having heard the submissions of both sides, I think I have to start vouching the essence of the objection raised. As shown before, the point of objection centres on failure on party of the applicant to 2ps. file a notice of application. It has been stated clearly that failure to file the notice renders this application incompetent. There is not dispute that the record shows, the notice was not filed before the CMA. What I think is important is to see, if failure to file the same notice renders the application incompetent. To be able to appreciate that, I have to refer to the wording of the law alleged infringed law. 2ps. 1ps. There is not dispute that the record shows, the notice was not filed before the CMA.

Dated at this. Presented for this. filing of day Applicant (year) of . day 5 Registry Clerk Copy: The respondent has vehemently argued that failure to file this form is fatal as it has been held in the three cases cited. In Arafat's case, it was held that since these are special forms, the same should be used and failure to apply the same renders the application incompetent. This decision was followed in Unilever (supra), and later, in the case of Anthony (supra). 2ps. When appreciating the two decisions, in the case of Anthony the court 11 equated it with the notice of appeal which if not filed, no appeal can be entertained. Having considered the wording of regulation 34(1) and the wording in the notice itself that is CMAF.10. I find nothing that suggests that the application before this court becomes incompetent merely because, the CMAF10 was not filed. 2ps. 1ps.

Having considered the wording of regulation 34(1) and the wording in the notice itself that is CMAF.10. I find nothing that suggests that the application before this court becomes incompetent merely because, the CMAF10 was not filed. I think so because, what the regulation insists is that forms named shall be used in all matters to which they refer. The words shall be used to matters which they refer, 2ps. are plain and need no construction. It means in my view, for instance, one should not use CMA.

        answer: |
          The court found there was nothing in regulation 34(1) or the CMAF.10 form itself to suggest that the application becomes incompetent solely because CMAF.10 was not filed.

        answer: |
          The court interpreted the phrase to mean that the named forms must be used for the specific matters to which they apply, but this requirement did not automatically invalidate an application for failing to file a particular form.

          How did the decision in the Anthony case differ from the final court ruling on CMAF.10?
        answer: |
          In the Anthony case, the court equated the failure to file CMAF.10 with not filing a notice of appeal, which would prevent an appeal from being entertained, but the final ruling in this case concluded that the application was not rendered incompetent due to the absence of CMAF.10.

      1ps. 1ps. I am saying so, because the conduct of proceedings in the labour court are governed by Labour court rules. It is apparent that Labour Court Rules, GN 106 of 2007 is made under section 55 of the Labour Institutions Act. The same are made by the chief Justice in consultation with the Minister. It is clear to me, that an application filed before this court may be considered incompetent, if it does not comply with section 94(1) of Employment and Labour Relations Act, Rules 24,28 and 55 of the Labour Court Rules, GN No. 106 of 2007. 2ps. I therefore hold that none compliance of regulation 34(1), does not affect an application that is already before ....... this court. 2ps. 1ps. It is apparent that Labour Court Rules, GN 106 of 2007 is made under section 55 of the Labour Institutions Act. The same are made by the chief Justice in consultation with the Minister. Striking an application that has been filed before this court merely because the CMA was not informed to prepare the pleadings and forward them to this court, is not different from striking out the matter that was heard interparty before the CMA but without proof that CMAF.3 or CMAF.4, which are summons to the parties and witnesses respectively were not used, or where, 2ps. parties appear before the court for revision without having been served with the summons renders their appearances illegal. This leads me to the conclusion that not every none compliance of the law renders a particular matter incompetent. Therefore, failure to file a notice under regulation 34(1) is not an incurably fatal illegality. 3ps. 1ps.
