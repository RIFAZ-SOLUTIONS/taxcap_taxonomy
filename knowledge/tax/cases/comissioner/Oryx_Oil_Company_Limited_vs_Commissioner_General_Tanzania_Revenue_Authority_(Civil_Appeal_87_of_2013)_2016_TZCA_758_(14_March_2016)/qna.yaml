      1ps. 1ps. Submitting in support of the preliminary objection, Mr. Haule argued that the appeal is defective because the decree of the Tribunal (the Decree) is only signed by the Vice-Chairman while it ought to have been signed by both the Vice-Chairman and the members of the Tribunal (all members). For that reason, Mr. Haule argued, the decree contravenes the provisions of Rule 21 2ps. of the Tribunal Rules. To bolster his argument, he cited the decisions of this Court in which a similar issue was dealt with. The cases include Midcom Tanzania Limited v. Commissioner General (TRA), Civil Appeal No. 13 of 2011 and Mbeya Intertrade Company Limited v. The Commissioner General, Civil Appeal No. 68 'A' of 2010 (both unreported). Mr. Haule argued that the defects renders the appeal 3ps. incurably defective. On that submission, he prayed that the preliminary objection be upheld. In response, Mr. Matunda opposed the preliminary objection. He argued that Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules applies only to decisions of the Tribunal, not decrees. 2ps. 1ps. On that submission, he prayed that the preliminary objection be upheld. In response, Mr. Matunda opposed the preliminary objection.

          What was the main argument presented by Mr. Haule in support of the preliminary objection?
        answer: |
          Mr. Haule argued that the appeal is defective because the decree of the Tribunal was signed only by the Vice-Chairman, whereas it should have been signed by both the Vice-Chairman and all members of the Tribunal, as required by Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules.

  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. In all the cases, the Court held that a decree of the Tribunal which is not signed by all members renders the appeal incurably defective. Although it is true that Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules refers to a decision, a decree is, under Rule 24(3) of the Tribunal Rules, read together with Rule 96 (2) (e) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 2009, a necessary document which a record of appeal must contain. In the case of Pembe Flour Mills Limited v. Commissioner General, TRA, 2ps. Civil Appeal No. 50 of 2015 (unreported), this Court stated as follows: "In terms o f Rule 14(1) o f the Tax Revenue Appeals Rules, the quorum in the Tribunal shall be three members of whom one shall be the Chairman or Vice- Chairman. This means that a decree , just like a decision of Tribunal\ must be signed by all members of the Tribunal." 2ps. 1ps. To be valid therefore, like a decision of the Tribunal, a decree must be signed in the same manner as the decision from which it arises. In the case of Pembe Flour Mills Limited v. Commissioner General, TRA, Civil Appeal No. 50 of 2015 (unreported), this Court stated as follows: "In terms o f Rule 14(1) o f the Tax Revenue Appeals 2ps. Rules, the quorum in the Tribunal shall be three members of whom one shall be the Chairman or Vice- Chairman. Having so observed, the Court rejected the argument similar to the one made by Mr. Matunda, that only the decision of the Tribunal is required to be included in the record of appeal as one of the necessary documents for the appeal.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What happens if a Tribunal decree is not signed by all its members?
        answer: |
          The Court held that such a decree renders the appeal incurably defective.
      - question: |
          What rules establish that a decree is a necessary document in a record of appeal?
        answer: |
          Rule 24(3) of the Tribunal Rules, read together with Rule 96(2)(e) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 2009, establishes that a decree is a necessary document in a record of appeal.
      - question: |
          What does Rule 14(1) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Rules state about the quorum of the Tribunal?
        answer: |
          Rule 14(1) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Rules states that the quorum in the Tribunal shall be three members, one of whom must be the Chairman or Vice-Chairman.
      - question: |
          What did the Pembe Flour Mills Limited v. Commissioner General, TRA case emphasize about decrees and Tribunal decisions?
        answer: |
          The case emphasized that a decree, like a decision of the Tribunal, must be signed by all members of the Tribunal to be valid.
      - question: |
          Why was the argument about including only the Tribunal's decision in the record of appeal rejected in the Pembe Flour Mills Limited case?
        answer: |
          The Court rejected the argument because both the decision and the decree of the Tribunal are required documents in the record of appeal.

      1ps. 1ps. As a general rule, a decision is held to have been given per incuriam if it is given in ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory provision or a binding authority. In the case of Kiriri Cotton Co. v. R.K. Dewani (1958) E.A. 239, the Eat African Court of Appeal quoted a passage in the judgment 2ps. of Sir Raymond Evershed, M.R. who stated the principle in Morelle Ltd v. Wakeling (1955)1 All E.R. 708 in the following words. This definition is not necessarily exhaustive, but cases not strictly within it which can properly be held to have been decided per incuriam must, in our judgment consistently with the stare decisis rule which is essential features of our law, be... of the rarest occurrence...." Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules 3ps. under which the preliminary objection was based states as follows: "21. 2ps. 1ps. "As a general rule, the only cases in which decisions should be held to have been given per in curiam are those of decisions given in ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory provisions or some authority binding on the Court concerned: so that in such case some part of the decision or some step in the reasoning on which it is based is found on that account, to be demonstrably wrong. Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules under which the 2ps. preliminary objection was based states as follows: "21. After conclusion of the hearing o f the evidence and submissions of the parties the tribunal shall, as soon as practicable make a decision in the presence of the parties or their advocates or representatives and shall cause a copy duly signed and certified by the members of the Tribunal which heard the appeal to be served on each party to the proceedings". 3ps.

      - question: |
          What case did the Eat African Court of Appeal reference to explain the concept of per incuriam?
        answer: |

        answer: |
          After the conclusion of evidence and submissions, the tribunal shall make a decision as soon as practicable in the presence of the parties or their representatives and shall serve a duly signed and certified copy on each party.

         the  foregoing  reasons,  we  hereby  uphold  the  preliminary objection.
