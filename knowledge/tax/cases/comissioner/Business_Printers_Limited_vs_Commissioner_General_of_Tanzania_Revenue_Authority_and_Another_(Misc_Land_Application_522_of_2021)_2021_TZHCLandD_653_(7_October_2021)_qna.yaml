      1ps. 1ps. I understand that the procedure for raising preliminary objections on points of law is that the Respondent or Defendant files a statement of defense wherein the point of law is raised or if it is an application, the Respondent shall canvass the objection in the Notice of Preliminary Objection. However, a trial without jurisdiction is a nullity and the importance of jurisdiction is the reason why it can be raised at any stage of a case, be it at the trial, on appeal to the Court of Appeal or before any steps have been taken in the suit or 2ps. application. Thus, it was correct on the part of the respondent to take up the issue of jurisdiction at the earliest stage of the proceedings before taking any other step in the proceedings, and that the Court was well within its ambit to entertain the issue of jurisdiction before embarking into the proceedings. 2ps. 1ps. It is advised that because the issue of jurisdiction is regarded as a threshold issue and a lifeline for continuing any proceedings, objection to it ought to be taken at the earliest opportunity and a decision should be reached on it before any other step in the proceedings is taken, because if there is no jurisdiction, the entire proceedings are a nullity no matter how well conducted. The Counsel for the applicant did not state any facts which are not in the records, the issue of jurisdiction has been gathered from the applicant's own pleadings and annexures. From 2ps. the annexures attached to the applicant's affidavit, the respondent took possession of the applicant's premises under the distress order. The applicant was notified by the Commissioner General of TRA under a distress warrant for payments of taxes.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are the two ways a Respondent or Defendant can raise preliminary objections on points of law?
        answer: |
          A Respondent or Defendant can raise preliminary objections on points of law either by filing a statement of defense where the point of law is raised or by canvassing the objection in the Notice of Preliminary Objection if it is an application.
      - question: |
          Why can the issue of jurisdiction be raised at any stage of a case?
        answer: |
          Jurisdiction can be raised at any stage of a case because a trial without jurisdiction is considered a nullity, and jurisdiction is a critical threshold issue that must be resolved before any further steps in the proceedings.
      - question: |
          What is the recommended approach for objecting to jurisdiction, and why?
        answer: |
          Objections to jurisdiction should be raised at the earliest opportunity because jurisdiction is a threshold issue, and if the court lacks jurisdiction, the entire proceedings become a nullity regardless of how well they are conducted.
      - question: |
          On what basis was jurisdiction determined in this case according to the applicant's pleadings?
        answer: |
          Jurisdiction was determined based on the applicant's own pleadings and annexures, which showed that the respondent took possession of the applicant's premises under a distress order notified by the Commissioner General of TRA for payment of taxes.
      - question: |
          Why was the respondentâ€™s decision to address the issue of jurisdiction at an early stage deemed appropriate?
        answer: |
          The respondentâ€™s decision was deemed appropriate because jurisdiction is fundamental to the validity of proceedings, and addressing it early ensures the court can make a decision on this threshold issue before proceeding further.
