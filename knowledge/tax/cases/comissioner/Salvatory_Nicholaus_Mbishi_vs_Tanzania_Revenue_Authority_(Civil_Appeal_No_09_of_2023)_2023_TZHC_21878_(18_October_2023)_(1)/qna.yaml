      1ps. 1ps. In my view of the above consideration of the trial court, I am of considered opinion the said court misdirected itself to grasp the pure point of law as envisaged by the case above, I am saying this because those were facts to be proved later before the court, nonetheless the same cannot be said in itself are conclusive. But also, the facts above do not protrude on the face of it any error on points of law raised as objection by the defendant. When it 2ps. observed that; 'A preliminary objection is in the nature of legal objection not based on the merits or facts of the case but on the stated legal procedural or technical grounds.

      1ps. 1ps. On the strength of her submission Ms. Justus prayed for the appeal to be allowed. I have thoroughly examined the trial court's record in relation to the grounds of appeal raised and also the submissions for and against the appeal. In determining whether the appeal has merit or not I will consider the two grounds of appeal together as they both point to the issue as to whether the trial court had jurisdiction 2ps. to hear the matter.

In my view of the pleading at the trial court, I find very appropriate to consider whether the raised preliminary objection raised was pure point of law. It is a trite law that preliminary objections must meet the test of a famous and celebrated case of Mukisa Biscuits Manufacturing Ltd. vs West End Distributors Ltd , 3ps. [1969] 1 EA 696 which defines what a preliminary objection is and also provides when it can be raised and when it should not be raised. 2ps. 1ps. Nevertheless, which caused the trial court to lack jurisdiction is due to the objection raised by the respondent therein.

For ease of reference, I quote the position set out in Mukisa Biscuits case as hereunder: "A preliminary objection is in the nature of 2ps. what used to be a demurrer.
