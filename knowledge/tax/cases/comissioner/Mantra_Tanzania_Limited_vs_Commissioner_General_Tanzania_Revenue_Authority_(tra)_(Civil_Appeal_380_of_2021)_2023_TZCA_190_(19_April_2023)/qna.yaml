    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What causes Clause 20 of the agreement to be considered self-contradictory?

The appeal follows prior unsuccessful challenges by the Appellant before the Tax Appeals Board and Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal. The Court sets out the facts, issues, and grounds for adjudication in the matter.
