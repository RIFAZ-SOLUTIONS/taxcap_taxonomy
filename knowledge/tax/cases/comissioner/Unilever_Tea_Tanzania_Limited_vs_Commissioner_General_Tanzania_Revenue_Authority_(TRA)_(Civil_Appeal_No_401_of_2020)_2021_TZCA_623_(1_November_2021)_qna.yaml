The appellant's counsel also 2ps. made reference to the respondent's proposals on management entertainment cost and proposal to settle the objections (Exhibits A-4, A-5 and A-7). It was strongly contended that the said evidence pointed out that despite the respondent acknowledging that the appellant added back/disallowed 50% of the management entertainment cost, the respondent still disallowed 50% of the management entertainment cost, resulting in double disallowance which the Tribunal failed to appreciate. 2ps. 1ps. It was, therefore, argued that the respondent's decision to disallow 50% of the management entertainment cost which had already been disallowed by 50% by the appellant amounted to double disallowance. The appellant's counsel also made reference to the respondent's proposals on management entertainment cost and proposal to settle the objections (Exhibits A-4, A-5 and A-7). Moreover, it was argued that the respondent's tax computations were unnecessary to prove double 2ps. disallowance whereas Exhibit A-7 (letters from the respondent to the appellant on the final determination of the objections) clearly showed that the respondent disallowed 50% of the management entertainment cost despite the undisputed fact that the same amount had been added back/disallowed by the appellant in her tax computations.

The issue was whether certain expenditure items were wholly and exclusively used in the production of the appellant's income. In consequence, the Tribunal vacated the Board's finding against the 2ps. appellant on that issue and ordered that the matter be remitted to the Board for it to hear both parties and determine the issue accordingly.
