  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. Submitting in support of the preliminary objection, Mr. Haule argued that the appeal is defective because the decree of the Tribunal (the Decree) is only signed by the Vice-Chairman while it ought to have been signed by both the Vice-Chairman and the members of the Tribunal (all members). For that reason, Mr. Haule argued, the decree contravenes the provisions of Rule 21 2ps. of the Tribunal Rules. To bolster his argument, he cited the decisions of this Court in which a similar issue was dealt with. The cases include Midcom Tanzania Limited v. Commissioner General (TRA), Civil Appeal No. 13 of 2011 and Mbeya Intertrade Company Limited v. The Commissioner General, Civil Appeal No. 68 'A' of 2010 (both unreported). Mr. Haule argued that the defects renders the appeal 3ps. incurably defective. On that submission, he prayed that the preliminary objection be upheld. In response, Mr. Matunda opposed the preliminary objection. He argued that Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules applies only to decisions of the Tribunal, not decrees. 2ps. 1ps. On that submission, he prayed that the preliminary objection be upheld. In response, Mr. Matunda opposed the preliminary objection. He argued that Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules applies only to decisions of the Tribunal, not decrees. He contended that, since the decision was signed and certified by all members, Rule 21 was complied with. He added that under Rule 23 of the Tribunal Rules, 2ps. issuing of a decree is mandatory only for the purpose of execution, otherwise a decree is not part of the Tribunal's decision required by law to be signed and certified by all members.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What was Mr. Haule's main argument regarding the appeal's defectiveness?
        answer: |
          Mr. Haule argued that the decree of the Tribunal was defective because it was signed only by the Vice-Chairman, instead of being signed by both the Vice-Chairman and all members of the Tribunal as required by Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules.
      - question: |
          Which precedents did Mr. Haule cite to support his argument?
        answer: |
          Mr. Haule cited two unreported cases: Midcom Tanzania Limited v. Commissioner General (TRA), Civil Appeal No. 13 of 2011, and Mbeya Intertrade Company Limited v. The Commissioner General, Civil Appeal No. 68 'A' of 2010.
      - question: |
          How did Mr. Matunda respond to the preliminary objection raised by Mr. Haule?
        answer: |
          Mr. Matunda opposed the preliminary objection, arguing that Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules only applies to decisions of the Tribunal and not to decrees.

        answer: |
          Mr. Matunda contended that the decision was properly signed and certified by all members as per Rule 21, and that a decree is only mandated under Rule 23 for purposes of execution, not as part of the decision requiring all members' signatures.
      - question: |
          What was Mr. Haule’s conclusion about the decree's defects, and what did he request the court to do?
        answer: |
          Mr. Haule concluded that the defects in the decree rendered the appeal incurably defective and prayed for the preliminary objection to be upheld.
  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. In all the cases, the Court held that a decree of the Tribunal which is not signed by all members renders the appeal incurably defective. Although it is true that Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules refers to a decision, a decree is, under Rule 24(3) of the Tribunal Rules, read together with Rule 96 (2) (e) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 2009, a necessary document which a record of appeal must contain. In the case of Pembe Flour Mills Limited v. Commissioner General, TRA, 2ps. Civil Appeal No. 50 of 2015 (unreported), this Court stated as follows: "In terms o f Rule 14(1) o f the Tax Revenue Appeals Rules, the quorum in the Tribunal shall be three members of whom one shall be the Chairman or Vice- Chairman. This means that a decree , just like a decision of Tribunal\ must be signed by all members of the Tribunal." 2ps. 1ps. To be valid therefore, like a decision of the Tribunal, a decree must be signed in the same manner as the decision from which it arises. In the case of Pembe Flour Mills Limited v. Commissioner General, TRA, Civil Appeal No. 50 of 2015 (unreported), this Court stated as follows: "In terms o f Rule 14(1) o f the Tax Revenue Appeals 2ps. Rules, the quorum in the Tribunal shall be three members of whom one shall be the Chairman or Vice- Chairman. Having so observed, the Court rejected the argument similar to the one made by Mr. Matunda, that only the decision of the Tribunal is required to be included in the record of appeal as one of the necessary documents for the appeal.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What makes a Tribunal's decree incurably defective according to the Court?
        answer: |
          A Tribunal's decree is incurably defective if it is not signed by all members as required.
      - question: |
          Which Tribunal Rules specify that both a decision and a decree must meet specific requirements for validity?
        answer: |
          Rule 21 and Rule 24(3) of the Tribunal Rules, read with Rule 96(2)(e) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 2009, outline the requirements for both a decision and a decree to be considered valid.
      - question: |
          What did the Court emphasize about the composition of the Tribunal quorum in the case of Pembe Flour Mills Limited v. Commissioner General, TRA?
        answer: |
          The Court emphasized that the Tribunal quorum must consist of three members, including one who must be the Chairman or Vice-Chairman, as stipulated in Rule 14(1) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Rules.
      - question: |
          Why did the Court reject the argument that only the Tribunal's decision is required in the record of appeal?
        answer: |
          The Court rejected this argument because both the decision and the decree are necessary documents that must be included in the record of appeal for validity.
      - question: |
          What is the relationship between the signing of a decision and a decree, as stated by the Court?
        answer: |
          The Court stated that a decree must be signed in the same manner as the decision from which it arises, meaning all Tribunal members must sign it for validity.
  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. As a general rule, a decision is held to have been given per incuriam if it is given in ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory provision or a binding authority. In the case of Kiriri Cotton Co. v. R.K. Dewani (1958) E.A. 239, the Eat African Court of Appeal quoted a passage in the judgment 2ps. of Sir Raymond Evershed, M.R. who stated the principle in Morelle Ltd v. Wakeling (1955)1 All E.R. 708 in the following words. This definition is not necessarily exhaustive, but cases not strictly within it which can properly be held to have been decided per incuriam must, in our judgment consistently with the stare decisis rule which is essential features of our law, be... of the rarest occurrence...." Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules 3ps. under which the preliminary objection was based states as follows: "21. 2ps. 1ps. "As a general rule, the only cases in which decisions should be held to have been given per in curiam are those of decisions given in ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory provisions or some authority binding on the Court concerned: so that in such case some part of the decision or some step in the reasoning on which it is based is found on that account, to be demonstrably wrong. Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules under which the 2ps. preliminary objection was based states as follows: "21. After conclusion of the hearing o f the evidence and submissions of the parties the tribunal shall, as soon as practicable make a decision in the presence of the parties or their advocates or representatives and shall cause a copy duly signed and certified by the members of the Tribunal which heard the appeal to be served on each party to the proceedings". 3ps.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the definition of a decision given per incuriam?
        answer: |
          A decision is considered to be given per incuriam if it is made in ignorance or forgetfulness of an inconsistent statutory provision or a binding authority, leading to a demonstrably wrong conclusion or reasoning.
      - question: |
          Which case established the principle referred to in the Kiriri Cotton Co. v. R.K. Dewani judgment?
        answer: |
          The principle referred to in Kiriri Cotton Co. v. R.K. Dewani was established in Morelle Ltd v. Wakeling (1955) 1 All E.R. 708.
      - question: |
          What did Sir Raymond Evershed, M.R., suggest about decisions made per incuriam?
        answer: |
          Sir Raymond Evershed, M.R., suggested that cases strictly meeting the definition of per incuriam are rare and must align with the stare decisis rule, which is a fundamental feature of law.
      - question: |
          What does Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules state about decisions made by the tribunal?
        answer: |
          Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules states that after the hearing of evidence and submissions, the tribunal must make a decision as soon as practicable in the presence of the parties or their representatives and provide a signed, certified copy to each party.
      - question: |
          What are the practical implications of a decision being deemed per incuriam?
        answer: |
          A decision deemed per incuriam is considered flawed due to oversight of binding legal authorities or statutory provisions, and its reasoning or outcome could be challenged as demonstrably incorrect.

      1ps. 1ps.  We therefore find  the  argument entirely devoid of merit. 
      
      On  the  basis  of
         the  foregoing  reasons,  we  hereby  uphold  the  preliminary objection. 
         The appeal which is incompetent for want of a valid decree is  hereby struck
         out with costs.
