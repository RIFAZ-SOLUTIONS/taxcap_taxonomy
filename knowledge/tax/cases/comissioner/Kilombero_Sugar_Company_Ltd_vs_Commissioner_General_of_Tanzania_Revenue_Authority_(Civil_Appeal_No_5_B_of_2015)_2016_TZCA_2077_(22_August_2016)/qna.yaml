  ### Document Outline
  This document details a ruling by the Court of Appeal of Tanzania in *Civil Appeal No. 5 of 2015*, where Kilombero Sugar Company Limited (Appellant) challenges a preliminary objection raised by the Commissioner General of Tanzania Revenue Authority (Respondent). The key issue is whether the lack of proper signatures on the Tribunal's decision and decree renders the appeal incompetent, with arguments presented by both parties regarding compliance with Rule 21 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal Rules, 2001, and related legal provisions.
