Ms. Karume repeated what she submitted in the Tribunal as to what constituted true construction of section 69(e) of the Income Tax Act (supra). It is imperative to reproduce what 2ps. is contained at page 237 of the record:- "Section 69(e) of the Income Tax Act 2004, does not contain the word "situated in"but in its true construction/meaning the section means "withholding tax is due on royalties paid for the use of, right to use or forbearance from using an asset inside or within the United Republic" and clearly there is little difference in the English language between saying that an asset is in the United Republic; 3ps. or an asset is inside the United Republic; or an asset is within the United Republic or an asset is situated in the United Republic". 2ps. 1ps.
