      1ps. 1ps. The question that must be answered is whether the determination of a Bill of costs can be said to fall under an application for enforcement of a court's decision. Enforcement, in my view necessarily connotes that something has come to a finale. Enforcement stipulated under item 20 would involve applications for garnishee orders, attachment gf immpvable or movable property, arrest and detention in civil prison etc. On the other hand, when a 2ps. Bill of Costs is filed in court hearing of the parties takes place and a finding is made. That finding can be complained against to a higher tribunal. In Kalunga and Company Advocates vs. National Bank of CommerceCivil Application No 113 of 2003 (unreported) a single judge of this Court considered a Bill of Costs filed in the High Court to be an 'inquiry'. He found that an appeal against the decision of that inquiry required leave in 3ps. terms of section 5 (1) of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act. 2ps. 1ps. That finding can be complained against to a higher tribunal. In Kalunga and Company Advocates vs. National Bank of CommerceCivil Application No 113 of 2003 (unreported) a single judge of this Court considered a Bill of Costs filed in the High Court to be an 'inquiry'. He found that an appeal against the decision of that inquiry required leave in terms of section 5 (1) of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act. Going by the definition of 'application' given 2ps. in the Law of Limitation Act I would agree with Mr. Maro that it is wide enough to include the filing of a Bill of Costs.

          What does item 20 stipulate regarding enforcement processes?
        answer: |
          Item 20 stipulates enforcement processes such as garnishee orders, attachment of movable or immovable property, and arrest and detention in civil prison.
