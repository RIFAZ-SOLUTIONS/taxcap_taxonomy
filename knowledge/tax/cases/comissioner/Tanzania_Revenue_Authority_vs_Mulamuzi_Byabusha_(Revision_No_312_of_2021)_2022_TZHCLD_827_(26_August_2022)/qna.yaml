    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What reasons were given by the applicant for the delay, and why were they deemed insufficient?
        answer: |
          The applicant cited reasons such as a pending case, the late serving of summons, and the advocate's child being sick. These were deemed insufficient because the pending case was dismissed, indicating a lack of due care, and the other reasons did not meet the threshold for good cause for delay.
      - question: |
          What specific example or case was cited to demonstrate the applicant's failure to take care of the case?
        answer: |
          The dismissal of the pending case was cited as proof that the applicant did not take care of the case.
      - question: |
          What legal principle was emphasized regarding the issue of illegality in the case?
        answer: |
          It was emphasized that in law, illegality must be evident on the face of the record to be considered valid.
      - question: |
          Why was the applicant's argument about the right to be heard dismissed?
        answer: |
          The argument was dismissed because the applicant was provided the right to be heard but failed to appear, leading to the matter being heard ex parte.
      - question: |

        answer: |
          The cases of Paulo Mbogo v The Republic and Magnet Construction Limited were cited. Paulo Mbogo was used to support the idea that the applicant failed to show good cause for the delay, and Magnet Construction Limited was likely referenced to support the legal argument about illegality.
