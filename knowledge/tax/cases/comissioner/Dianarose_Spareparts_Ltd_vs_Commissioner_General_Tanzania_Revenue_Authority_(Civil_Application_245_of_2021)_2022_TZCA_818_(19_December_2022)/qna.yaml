Other grounds advanced by Mr. Wawa in support of the application were that: - i) The intended appeal raises important points of law. - ii) The delay is not inordinate, and - iii) The judgment sought to be challenged on appeal is fraught with some material irregularities. In reply Mr. Leyan Sabore learned counsel appearing for the respondent was diametrically opposed to Mr. Wawa's contention regarding indisposition of the proprietor of the secretarial bureau. With regard to the 2ps. case of P.B. Patel v. The Star Mineral Water and Ice Factory (Uganda) Ltd (1961) E.A. 454 which Mr. Wawa relied on in support of the position that, sickness has been considered to be a good cause to explain away the delay to take necessary steps, Mr. Sabore submitted correctly so in my view that, the evidence presented to the Court did not prove that fact. 2ps. 1ps.

Moreover, Mr. Sabore could not agree with Mr.
    questions_and_answers:

  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. It is as well common ground that, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to the question as to what in law, constitutes good cause. It is for that reason that in the case of Seif Store Limited (supra), we stated that: "The interpretation of what constitutes good cause is entirely left to the discretion of the court, a subjective approach. However, categories of what constitutes a good cause are never dosed." The ill-defined nature of what constitutes "good cause" for purposes 2ps. of extension of time is also reflected in our decision in the case of Geita Gold Mining Limited V. Twalib Ally Civil Application No. 14 of 2012 (unreported) to which we were referred by Mr. Wawa. Given the nature of the facts and circumstances obtaining in that case, we held that: "Good cause may debatably be inferred from the fact that the applicant has a statutory right of appeal whose enjoyment it has promptly begun to process." 2ps. 1ps. However, categories of what constitutes a good cause are never dosed." The ill-defined nature of what constitutes "good cause" for purposes of extension of time is also reflected in our decision in the case of Geita Gold Mining Limited V. Twalib Ally Civil Application No. 14 of 2012 (unreported) to which we were referred by Mr. Wawa. Going by the above-cited authorities and many others, it stands to reason that in application for extension of time, good cause depends on facts and 2ps. circumstances of each case.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the court's stance on what constitutes 'good cause' in legal contexts?
        answer: |
          'Good cause' is subjectively determined at the discretion of the court, with no hard and fast rules or exhaustive categories defining it.
      - question: |
          What observation does the case of Seif Store Limited make about 'good cause'?
        answer: |
          The case of Seif Store Limited states that the interpretation of 'good cause' is discretionary and that the categories of what constitutes it are never closed.
      - question: |
          How did the court decide on 'good cause' in Geita Gold Mining Limited v. Twalib Ally?
        answer: |
          The court inferred 'good cause' from the fact that the applicant had a statutory right of appeal, which they promptly began to process.
      - question: |
          Why is the concept of 'good cause' described as ill-defined for the purpose of extending time?
        answer: |
          It is described as ill-defined because its determination depends on the specific facts and circumstances of each case, making it inherently variable.
      - question: |
          What is the common ground about 'good cause' mentioned in the context?
        answer: |
          The common ground is that there are no hard and fast rules for determining 'good cause' in legal terms.
  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. Like in the last cited case, I think that in the instant case, Mr. Wawa who is the applicant's advocate cannot purport to depose on another person's alleged illness and recovery from covid-19 without any supporting evidence by way of deposition from that person. Nor can I accept Mr. Wawa's flimsy explanation that the said person had refused to swear an affidavit in support of the claim of her alleged indisposition. With regard to the allegation that the intended appeal raises 2ps. some important points of law and that the decision by the TRAT is fraught with some material irregularities, I am not satisfied that, that is the case, if truth be told. With due respect, I think the contention that the TRAT decision is fraught with some material irregularities, being the applicant's last remaining holdouts, was added to the application 3ps. as an afterthought. 2ps. 1ps. I therefore take it that the claim that the person who was entrusted to photocopy the documents forming the record of appeal got sick as not to be able to make the copies in time, was not established by evidence. With regard to the allegation that the intended appeal raises some important points of law and that the decision by the TRAT is fraught with some material irregularities, I am 2ps. not satisfied that, that is the case, if truth be told. This is because, as I see it and as correctly submitted by Mr. Sabore, there is nothing suggesting, albeit prima facie' that the decision made by the TRAT is suffering from any material irregularity or that the intended appeal raises any important question of law worth of determination by this Court. This, in my respectful view, is an assertion which may 3ps.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What criticism did the judge express about Mr. Wawa's claim regarding the alleged illness and recovery of a person?
        answer: |
          The judge criticized Mr. Wawa for attempting to depose about another person's alleged illness and recovery from COVID-19 without supporting evidence or a deposition directly from that person. The judge also rejected Mr. Wawa’s explanation that the person had refused to swear an affidavit.
      - question: |
          Why did the judge dismiss the claim that the TRAT decision had material irregularities?

      - question: |
          What reasoning did the judge give for rejecting the request to extend the appeal on grounds of illness-related delays?
        answer: |
          The judge rejected the request because the claim that the person entrusted to photocopy the documents fell ill was not supported by evidence.
      - question: |
          What did the judge say about the contention that the TRAT decision being irregular was a key basis for the application?
        answer: |
          The judge stated that the contention about material irregularities in the TRAT decision was added to the application as an afterthought and lacked substantiation.
      - question: |
          What was the judge’s stance on whether the intended appeal raised important points of law?
