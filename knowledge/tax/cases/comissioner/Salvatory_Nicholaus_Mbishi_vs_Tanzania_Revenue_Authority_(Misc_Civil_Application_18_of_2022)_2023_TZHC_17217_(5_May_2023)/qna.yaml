      1ps. 1ps. With much respect to the learned State Attorney, I will not entertain this issue as it was improperly raised in the course of written submission. Besides, even if it was properly raised, it would definitely fail as it appears to be a mere clerical error curable by the principle of overriding objective enshrined under section 3A and 38B of the Civil Procedure Code [Cap 33 RE 2019]. Having resolved the above issue, I now turn to Mr. Magoma's 2ps. submission as regards whether this application was properly filed. The learned State Attorney has argued that, the present application was prematurely filed because the duration within which to appeal to this court had not lapsed when the applicant filed the present application in court. Cementing his argument, he has argued that, the duration within which to appeal from the 3ps. Court of the Resident Magistrate to this court is 30 days. 2ps. 1ps.

      1ps. 1ps. Section 19(2) of the Law of Limitation Act which Mr. Magoma has cited in support of submission states thus; 19.-(2) In computing the period of limitation prescribed for an appeal, an application for leave to appeal, or an application for review of judgment, the day on which the judgment complained of was delivered, and the period of time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree or order appealed from or sought to be reviewed, shall be excluded. Interpreting the above provision in Alex Senkoro, the Court of Appeal stated that; "We entertain 2ps. no doubt that the above sub-sections expressly allow automatic exclusion of the period of time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree or judgment appealed from the computation of the prescribed limitation period. Such an exclusion need not be made upon an order of the court in a formal application for extension of time." 2ps. 1ps. It is in this context, section 19(2) of the Law of Limitation Act is coined to protect the appellant who would otherwise be wrongly condemned for a delay wholly occasioned by the court's failure to furnish him with the copy of judgment, ruling, decree or drawn order, as the case in point. Such an exclusion need not be made upon an order of the court in a formal application for extension of time." Also, the Court took the same stance in Methuselah Enoka 2ps. (supra), where it did not only acknowledge the automatic exclusion but also stated that there is no need for a separate application nor according any attachment to a memorandum of appeal.
    questions_and_answers:

          What does Section 19(2) of the Law of Limitation Act stipulate?
        answer: |
          Section 19(2) states that, when computing the limitation period for an appeal, application for leave to appeal, or application for review, the day the judgment was delivered and the time required to obtain a copy of the decree or order are excluded.
      - question: |
          How did the Court of Appeal interpret Section 19(2) in the Alex Senkoro case?
        answer: |
          The Court of Appeal affirmed that Section 19(2) allows an automatic exclusion of time required to obtain copies of decrees or judgments from the limitation calculation, without requiring a formal court order or application for extension.
      - question: |
          Why was Section 19(2) described as being 'coined to protect the appellant'?
        answer: |
          The provision protects the appellant from being unfairly penalized for delays caused by the court’s failure to provide a judgment, ruling, decree, or drawn order on time.
      - question: |
          What additional clarification did the Court of Appeal provide in the Methuselah Enoka case?

  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps.   Much as it is true that the time within which to file the appeal has lapsed
         and the said time was spent while pursuing the present application, it will
         be unjust to condemn and punish the applicant  who has been  diligently
         prosecuting  the present  application mistakenly believing that,  he was
         legally obliged  so.   It is in  my considered view that the delay occasioned
         while pursuing this application is a technical one and excusable as he has
         diligently pursued his right in this court.   The  costs
      2ps. are to  be  shared  by each of the parties shouldering its respective costs.
      DATED at DELIVERED at MOSHI this 5th  day of May 2023.
