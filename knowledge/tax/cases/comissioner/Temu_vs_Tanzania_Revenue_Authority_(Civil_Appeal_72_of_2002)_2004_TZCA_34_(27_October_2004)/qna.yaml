      1ps. 1ps. Kipindi hicho kitakapokwisha, Shirika litapaswa kuamua kama litamchukua mhusika kama mtumishi wake wa kudumu au la. Ikiwa atachukuliwa, basi atafuata masharti yaliyomo katika Waraka huu. Iwapo Shirika litaamua kutomchukuwa, mhusika atarejeshwa alikotoka bila ya kuchelewa. Endapo kipindi hicho kitakuwa kimepita na Shirika halikuchukua hatua zozote za kumchukua au kumrejesha, na kama 2ps. mhusika hatakuwa ameomba kurudi alikotoka, itachukuliwa kwamba ameingia katika utumishi wa kudumu wa Shirika. Two things are obvious to us here: One, the initiative of moving an employee from a ministry to a parastatal is of the parastatal itself, which under paragraph 4 is required to make an application to the Central Establishment. There was no such application here and we think it was because all employees connected with taxation and custom duties were seconded to TRA from MOF. Nevertheless, the initiative in this case came from TRA who wrote 3ps. Exh. P 1 offering employment to Stella in TRA. The second thing is that an employee so seconded is taken on probation for one year. This is what was contained in Exh. 2ps. 1ps. P 1 offering employment to Stella in TRA. The second thing is that an employee so seconded is taken on probation for one year. This is what was contained in Exh. P 1. The import of paragraph 3 is driven home by the provisions of paragraph 11 which gives the third category of service, that is, departmental transfer or "uhamisho wa moja kwa moja": ## 11. Utaratibu wa Uhamisho wa Moja kwa Moja: Uhamisho wa moja kwa moja kutoka Serikalini kwenda Shirika la 2ps. Umma hufanyika baada ya mtumishi aliyeazimwa kumaliza muda wake wa kuazimwa kama ilivyoelezwa katika ibara ya [3] hapo juu.

For the same reason the learned judge found that Stella was not defamed and, therefore, declined to grant her damages instead he gave her general damages of shs. 2,000,000/= "for the wrongful termination of her probationary employment". Stella is aggrieved with that judgment and has preferred this appeal having four grounds. Before us she was represented by Mr. Malamsha, learned counsel, while TRA had the services of Mr. Rugaiya, learned advocate. Briefly the four grounds were that the learned trial judge erred by: - i. Not annulling the termination and ordering reinstatement. - ii. Framing 2ps. new issues suo motu for which there were neither evidence nor submissions. - iii. Granting reliefs not prayed for. - iv. Subjecting the appellant to double jeopardy of wrongful termination by the respondent and termination by the court.

Subjecting the appellant to double jeopardy of wrongful termination by the respondent and termination by the court.

His was a dissenting judgment but the dissent was not 2ps. concerned with this point.

However, we intend to use section 4 (2) of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1979, as amended by Act No. 17 of 1993, and revise the proceedings. That section provides as follows: For all purposes of and incidental to the hearing and determination of any appeal in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred upon it by this Act, the Court 2ps. of Appeal shall, in addition to any other power, authority and jurisdiction conferred by this Act, have the power of revision and the power, authority and jurisdiction vested in the Court from which the appeal is brought.

Miller [1980] LRC (Const.) 654. Unfortunately it has not been possible for us to lay our hands on that law report in Arusha. 2ps. 1ps.
