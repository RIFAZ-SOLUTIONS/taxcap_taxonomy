      1ps. 1ps. However, the above position of the law notwithstanding, we have observed the following in relation to this complaint. It is on record that, the goods were examined and found to have complied with all customs requirements and fit for human consumption before they were cleared to the bonded warehouse pending payment of duties and taxes. Hie goods expired because they overstayed in the bonded warehouse as the appellant failed to pay the taxes within the prescribed period. The record further shows that the 2ps. appellant communicated with the manufacturer concerning the said goods who confirmed them to be fit for human consumption. Thus, if at ali the appellant intended to abandon them it was because he wanted to preserve the brand and not otherwise. In the circumstances, she ought to have followed the proper procedure to get the Commissioner's permission as stated above. Since there was no such permission, it cannot be said with certainty that the 3ps. goods were abandoned as correctly, in our view, decided by the Tribunal. This ground too fails. 2ps. 1ps. In the circumstances, she ought to have followed the proper procedure to get the Commissioner's permission as stated above. Since there was no such permission, it cannot be said with certainty that the goods were abandoned as correctly, in our view, decided by the Tribunal. This ground too fails. Before we conclude, we would like to say something about the issue raised by the appellant '' whether there 2ps. is no iaw which empowers the Commissioner to charge duties and taxes on goods which are still in the customs control". We have considered this matter and we are in agreement with the respondent that this is a new issue which was never raised and dealt with by the Board and the Tribunal.

          The goods expired because they overstayed in the bonded warehouse as the appellant failed to pay the required duties and taxes within the prescribed period.
      - question: |
          What confirmation did the appellant receive from the manufacturer regarding the goods?
        answer: |
          The appellant communicated with the manufacturer, who confirmed that the goods were fit for human consumption.
      - question: |
          Why was it determined that the goods were not officially abandoned?
        answer: |
          The goods were not considered abandoned because the appellant did not follow the proper procedure to get the Commissionerâ€™s permission to abandon them.
      - question: |
          What was the Tribunal's decision regarding the abandonment of the goods?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal decided, correctly in the view of the reviewing body, that the goods could not be considered abandoned because the required permission from the Commissioner was not obtained.

          Why was the appellant's question about the Commissionerâ€™s power to charge duties not addressed?

For ease of reference, we shall reproduce this provision of law as follows: - "57. - (3) Where any goods are sold under the provisions of this section, then the proceeds of such sale shall be applied in the order set out beiow in the discharge of- - (a) the duties; - (b) the expenses of the sale; - (c) any rent and charges due to the Customs or to the warehouse keeper; - (d) the port charges; and - (e) the freight and any other 2ps. charges." (Emphasis ours). While the appellant took refuge under this provision that the goods were abandoned, our understanding of the same is that the provision relates to sale by public auction of the goods which have not been reÂ­ warehoused and how the proceeds of the sale are distributed. The provision does not at alt deal with the abandonment of goods as claimed by the appellant. Furthermore, as correctly stated by the Tribunal, the said provision 3ps. contemplates a situation where the goods are not re-warehoused and are commercially viable. 2ps. 1ps.

          What misunderstanding did the appellant have regarding the provision?

        answer: |
