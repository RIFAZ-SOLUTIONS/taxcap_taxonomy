  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. We are fortified in that account because in order to ascertain the meaning of a clause in a statute, courts must look at the whole statute, at what precedes and what succeeds and not merely the clause itself and also compare the clause with other parts of the law and the setting in which it occurs. If we can apply the rule therefore, the phrases 'other decisions' or 'omissions' must be of the same nature as tax decisions and not otherwise. This was emphasized in the case of PAN AFRICAN ENERGY TANZANIA LTD VS 2ps. COMMISSIONER GENERAL (TRA) (supra) whereby, having considered sections, 51 and 53 of TAA which makes cross reference to the effect that an appeal to the Board has to be in accordance with section 16 (1) of the TRAA we said: "...it is significantly discernible that an appeal to the Board is presently narrowed down to an objection decision of the CG made under the TAA. 2ps. 1ps. If we can apply the rule therefore, the phrases 'other decisions' or 'omissions' must be of the same nature as tax decisions and not otherwise. Thus, in the light of the unambiguous and plain language used in section 50 (1) of what is a tax decision, we are satisfied that, refusal to grant the waiver is excluded in the realm of what constitutes a tax decision and neither is it an objection decision. It is 2ps.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why must courts examine the whole statute rather than focusing on a single clause when interpreting its meaning?

          Courts must consider the entire statute, including preceding and succeeding clauses, to ascertain the meaning of a specific clause and compare it with other parts of the law and its context.

          What principle is applied to interpret the meaning of the phrases 'other decisions' or 'omissions' in the statute?

      - question: |
          What case emphasized the interpretation of appealable decisions in the context of tax law?
        answer: |
          The case of PAN AFRICAN ENERGY TANZANIA LTD VS COMMISSIONER GENERAL (TRA) emphasized the interpretation of appealable decisions in the context of tax law.
      - question: |
          What is required for an appeal to be made to the Board according to this interpretation?
        answer: |
          An appeal to the Board must be in accordance with section 16 (1) of the TRAA and pertains strictly to an objection decision of the Commissioner General made under the TAA.

          Why is the refusal to grant a waiver not considered a tax decision or an objection decision?

  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. We say so because: Firstly, in terms of section 50 (1) of the TAA, the respondent is mandated to make any tax decision including 'assessment' or 'other decision7 or 'omission' on a matter left to the discretion, judgment, direction, opinion, approval, consent, satisfaction or determination of the Commissioner General under a tax law that directly affects a person. It is glaring that the whole of section 50 2ps. defines and regulates tax decisions left to the discretion, judgment, direction, opinion, approval, consent, satisfaction or determination of the Commissioner General. In particular, under section 50 (1) of the TAA, the preposition ' including' between the phrases 'any tax decision' and Assessment' or 'other decision' or 'omission' means that the former is a larger group which embraces the latter. This is cemented by a 3ps. latin maxim of ejusdem generis rule which means 'of the same kind'. The rule requires that: where in a statute there are genera! words following particular specific words, the genera1 words must be confined to things of the same kind as those specifically mentioned. http://ca.Dracticallaw.thomsonreuters.com. 2ps. 1ps. The rule requires that: where in a statute there are genera! words following particular specific words, the genera1 words must be confined to things of the same kind as those specifically mentioned. http://ca.Dracticallaw.thomsonreuters.com.

      - question: |
          What is the significance of the word 'including' in section 50 (1) of the TAA?

      1ps. 1ps. In the same vein, in the absence of any inconsistencies in the provisions in question that the refusal to grant the waiver is neither a tax decision nor an objection decision which can be appealed against before the Board, we decline the appellant's counsel invitation to invoke the harmonious construction of the provisions in question. The objects and reasons among other things, included the 2ps. following: "Tangu kuanzishwa kwa Mamlaka ya Mapato pamoja na maboresho yaiiyofanyika, pamekuwa na ugumu wa utekelezaji wa sheria za kodi katika maeneo yafuatayo: - - (i) Not applicable. - (ii)Not applicable - (iii) Kuwepo kwa usumbufu kwa waiipa kodi unaotokana na taratibu za usimamizi na utawala zinazotofautiana kwa kifa aina ya kodi ambayo wakati mwingine husababisha waiipa kodi kupoteza haki zao za msingi biia sababu."

The objects and reasons among other things, included the following: "Tangu kuanzishwa kwa Mamlaka ya Mapato pamoja na maboresho yaiiyofanyika, pamekuwa na ugumu wa utekelezaji wa sheria za kodi katika maeneo yafuatayo: - - (i) Not applicable. - (ii)Not applicable - (iii) Kuwepo kwa usumbufu kwa waiipa kodi unaotokana na taratibu za usimamizi na utawala zinazotofautiana kwa kifa aina ya kodi ambayo wakati mwingine husababisha waiipa kodi kupoteza haki zao za msingi biia sababu." 2ps.
