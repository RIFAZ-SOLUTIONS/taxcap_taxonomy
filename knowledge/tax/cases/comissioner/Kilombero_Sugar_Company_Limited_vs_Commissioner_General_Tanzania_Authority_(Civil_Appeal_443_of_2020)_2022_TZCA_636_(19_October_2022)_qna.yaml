For this reason, ground one of appeal succeeds. Now, applying Article IV(l) of the DTA to the instant case, it seems obvious to us that the appellant paid service fees (management fees) to the ZSCL, which, applying the source and 2ps. residence tests, would be subject to withholding tax in Tanzania under sections 6(1Xb), 69(iXD and 83(1Xb) of the ITA not only because the appellant is a company resident in Tanzania but also because the income paid to ZSCL has a source in Tanzania.
