      1ps. 1ps. At the end, the learned Senior State Attorney impressed upon the Court to dismiss the application with costs. When asked by the Court, whether the goods crossed the border, he replied that they were still in the bonded warehouse. Mr. Shayo re-joined that as the learned Senior State Attorney conceded that the goods did not cross border, the Commissioner had no authority under the law to impose taxes and duties on goods that have not yet 2ps. crossed the border controls. He further contended that, if the goods were found unfit for human consumption, the respondent ought to have made an order of re- exportation of goods but not to impose taxes on uncleared goods. He therefore reiterated his earlier submission and urged the Court to allow the application with costs. 2ps. 1ps.

      1ps. 1ps. He contended that the issue which the parties were at variance before the Board was on payment of custom duties and taxes for abandoned goods as correctly reflected at page 4 of the judgment of the Court. He added that if the Court had considered the full legal effect of the letter dated 5th January, 2016 it could have discovered that the condition imposed 2ps. by that letter for the respondent to accept the abandonment of the goods was illegal and the refusal had no legal effect. He pointed out that the issue before the Board was whether the applicant was liable to pay custom duties and taxes in respect of abandoned goods and the issue before the Court was whether there is any law which empowers 3ps. the Commissioner to charge duties and taxes on goods that are still in the customs control. 2ps. 1ps. He added that if the Court had considered the full legal effect of the letter dated 5th January, 2016 it could have discovered that the condition imposed by that letter for the respondent to accept the abandonment of the goods was illegal and the refusal had no legal effect. To him, these issues are one and the same because, he said, the liability of the applicant to pay 2ps. custom duties and taxes in respect of abandoned goods which were still in the bonded warehouse is the same thing as to ask whether the respondent has legal power to levy or charge custom duties and taxes on the goods which were destroyed while still in the customs control (bonded warehouse). Lastly, on the alleged apparent error, Mr. Shayo adverted us to page 19 of the judgment where the Court held that 3ps. the applicant was liable to pay custom duties and taxes.

      - question: |
          What was the main issue in dispute before the Board and the Court?
        answer: |
          The main issue in dispute was whether the applicant was liable to pay custom duties and taxes on goods that were abandoned and still under customs control.

        answer: |

          The applicant claimed that the liability for duties and taxes on abandoned goods in a bonded warehouse was the same as questioning the respondent's legal authority to levy or charge duties on goods destroyed while under customs control.
      - question: |
          What was Mr. Shayo's argument concerning the Court's consideration of the issues?
        answer: |

      - question: |
          What apparent error did Mr. Shayo point out in the Court's judgment?
