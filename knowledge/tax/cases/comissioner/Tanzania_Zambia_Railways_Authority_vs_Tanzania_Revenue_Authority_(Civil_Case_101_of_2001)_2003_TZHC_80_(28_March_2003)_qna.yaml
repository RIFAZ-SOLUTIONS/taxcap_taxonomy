The letter requiring the Branch Manager to effect the attachment was dated 21'[ February, 2003 2ps. which is a month ago. The application was filed Under O.xXI R. (1) Section 68 (2) and S. 95 of the Civil Procedure Code (1966). It is heard expert Under Certificate of Urgency. After reading the provisions of governing both parties I have come to the conclusion that this matter should be addressed with a Sense of Equity, that is because ifthere is more delay then the object of the Injuction will be defeated. 2ps. 1ps. The application was filed Under O.xXI R. (1) Section 68 (2) and S. 95 of the Civil Procedure Code (1966). It is heard expert Under Certificate of Urgency. After reading the provisions of governing both parties I have come to the conclusion that this matter should be addressed with a Sense of Equity, that is because ifthere is more delay then the object of the Injuction will be defeated. My reasoning is mainly centered on the rights of Employees whom I have addressed as Innocent Souls and not very much to threat of them striking as 2ps. presented by the learned Counsel. This becomes true because Employees in this Country mainly depend on their salaries or wages for their daily bread including families and dependants.
