      1ps. 1ps. It appears to us that since the obligation on the appellant under Rule 90 (1) of the Rules is contingent upon the respondent complying with the requirement under Rule 79 (1) (a) of the Rules, and since the respondent does not appear to have complied with that rule, the obligation on the appellant to serve both the memorandum of appeal and the record of appeal on the respondent within the 2ps. period stipulated under Rule 90 (1) of the Rules does not arise. We, therefore, dismiss that ground of objection. The decision against which the appeal is sought was pronounced by the High Court on 10t h March, 2005 but the extracted order was signed by the judge who gave the ruling on 19t h December, 2005. The dating and signing of the extracted order appears under the following words - "Given under my hand and the Seal of 3ps. the Court this 19t h day of December, 2005." Obviously, the date differs from the date the ruling of the court was given. 2ps. 1ps. We now wish to consider ground (3) in the Supplementary Notice of Preliminary Objection.

  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. He did not proceed to argue against the second ground of objection. We intend to dispose of ground (2) of the grounds of preliminary objection. Rule 90 (1) of the Court of Appeal Rules, 1979 (the Rules) provides as under:- "90 (1) The appellant shall, before or within seven days after lodging the memorandum of appeal and the record of appeal in the appropriate registry, serve copies of them on each respondent who has complied with the requirements of 2ps. Rule 79." It is apparent that the appellant lodged his memorandum of appeal in the Court registry on 22n d March, 2006 and the record of appeal on 13t h July, 2006. He was, therefore, required to serve on the respondent both the copy of the memorandum of appeal and of the record of appeal within seven days of the lodging of those documents if the respondent had complied with Rule 79 of the Rules. It will be recalled that Mr. Teemba informed the Court that the 3ps. respondent was not so served within the stipulated period. 2ps. 1ps.

It will be recalled that Mr. Teemba informed the Court that the respondent was not so served within the stipulated 2ps. period. It was served on 13t h July, 2006 which was some 113 days after the memorandum of appeal was lodged in the Registry, which would appear to be well beyond seven days.

      1ps. 1ps. The question now is, what would be the legal status of an appeal which is accompanied by an extracted order which does not bear the date when the ruling was pronounced? We have not been able to find from the available resources judicial pronouncements specifically on orders. Mulla on The Code of Civil Procedure, Fifteenth Edition at page 1524 commenting on rule 7 of Order 20 2ps. which is rendered substantially like rule 7 of Order 20 of the Act underscored the importance of the date of a decree. He said:- "Under this rule, the decree comes into existence on the date of the judgment, though it is signed later. Decree comes into existence as soon as the judgment is pronounced and not on the day it is signed and sealed later. For the purpose of 3ps. appeal, time runs from the date of pronouncement of the judgment." We think that is the correct position in law. We also think that, again, on a parity of reasoning, the same should be the case with extracted orders mutatis mutandis. 2ps. 1ps. For the purpose of appeal, time runs from the date of pronouncement of the judgment." We think that is the correct position in law. We also think that, again, on a parity of reasoning, the same should be the case with extracted orders mutatis mutandis. The date of a decree, and by extension of an order, is important not only in reckoning time for appeal but also for purposes 2ps. of period of limitation in the case of an application to set aside an exparte decree or order. Furthermore, the right to execute a decree or order accrues from the date it is pronounced, not on the day it is signed.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What issue arises with an appeal accompanied by an extracted order lacking the date of the ruling's pronouncement?
        answer: |
          The legal status of such an appeal is uncertain, as there are no specific judicial pronouncements addressing orders without dates of pronouncement.
      - question: |
          According to Mulla's commentary on rule 7 of Order 20 in The Code of Civil Procedure, when does a decree come into existence?
        answer: |
          A decree comes into existence on the date the judgment is pronounced, though it may be signed and sealed on a later date.
      - question: |
          How does the date of a decree or order affect the time for filing an appeal?
        answer: |
          For appeals, time starts running from the date of pronouncement of the judgment or order, not from the date it is signed.
      - question: |
          What period-related legal considerations depend on the date of pronouncement of a decree or order?
        answer: |
          The date of pronouncement is crucial for determining the period of limitation for appeals, applications to set aside ex parte decrees or orders, and the accrual of the right to execute a decree or order.
      - question: |
          What reasoning applies to extracted orders regarding the importance of the date of pronouncement?
        answer: |
          By parity of reasoning, the same principle that applies to decrees—the importance of the date of pronouncement for determining legal timelines—applies mutatis mutandis to extracted orders.
