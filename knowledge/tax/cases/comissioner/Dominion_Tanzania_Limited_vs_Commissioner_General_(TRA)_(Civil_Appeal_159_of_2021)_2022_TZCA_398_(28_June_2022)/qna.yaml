[Emphasis added] Although in the opinion of the appellant the decision in Tullow Tanzania BV's case is bad law, on the contrary, it is our considered view that is correct position of the law to which we subscribe. We are mindful of the fact that M r.

It was advanced 2ps. in the cases of National Microfinance Bank Limited v. Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 168 of 2018 and Ophir Tanzania (Block 1) Limited v. Commissioner General Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 58 of 2020 (both unreported).
