That means that the respondent could not have made an objection decision capable of being appealed from in terms of section 16(1) of the TRAA. Contrary to the learned advocate, we do not think 2ps. he is correct in submitting as he did that the Court took a narrow approach in excluding other decisions and omissions from the realm of appellable decisions.

Section 16 (1) of TRAA as amended by section 110 of TAA provides: "Any person who is aggrieved by an objection decision 3ps. of the Commissioner ## General made under the Tax Administration Act may appeal to the Board".

From the contentions in that appeal, the Board framed one main issue for its determination, that is to say; whether the respondent's decision demanding payment from the appellant without lodging an application for execution was lawful.

The Board relied on the decision of the Tribunal in Tullow Tanzania BV v. Commissioner General, TRA, Tax Appeal No.
