      1ps. 1ps. That is the situation in the instant case. The Certificate o f Incentives issued to the applicant has no mention of VAT. That being the position, I think that it would be overzealous to hold that the applicant has shown a prima facie case with a probability of success. As to the question of irreparable loss, I do 2ps. not think that there can be envisaged such loss to the applicant as would not be compensated by an award of damages. It is also not impertinent to add here that in addition to the principles enunciated above, when temporary injunctions are sought to be made against public authorities charged with the duty of collecting public revenue, such application must not 3ps. be lightly granted by the courts. While the courts are duty-bound to protect the innocent public against abuse of power by tax authorities, the courts must not be oblivious of public policy. My learned brother Judge, Katiti, ./. expressed a similar view, if not even more candidly, in the case of Mufindi Tea Co.'JAmited 2ps. 1ps.

        answer: |
          The case of Mufindi Tea Co. Limited v. Tanzania Revenue Authority (Dar es Salaam Miscellaneous Civil Cause No. 139 of 1999) was referenced to support the court's view.
