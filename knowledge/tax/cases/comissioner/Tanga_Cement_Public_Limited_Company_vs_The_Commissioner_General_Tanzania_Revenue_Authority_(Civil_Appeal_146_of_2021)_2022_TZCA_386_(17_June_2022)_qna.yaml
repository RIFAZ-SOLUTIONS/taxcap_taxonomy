      1ps. 1ps. We have considered the arguments of both learned counsel and have also reviewed the necessary exhibits in question and the issue for our consideration, we think, is whether the respondent was wrong to impose tax in respect of interest for understated installment income tax i n the year of income 2014. The relevant law is section 99 (1) of the ITA with the side notes "Interest for Understating Tax Payable by Installments." The undisputed calculations that were made by the Board, the instalment tax was 71.3% of the 2ps. actual tax. The amount self-assessed being less than 80% of the actual amount, the respondent was right to invoke his statutory powers to charge the tax as she did. Secondly, Mr. Mukebezi challenged the respondent for not having considered and replied to the letter dated 7t h January, 2015. His point was that, by failure to reply to the appellant's application contained in that letter, and instead imposing the tax 3ps. was an arbitrary act, hence ill egal. 2ps. 1ps. The undisputed calculations that were made by the Board, the instalment tax was 71.3% of the actual tax. The amount self-assessed being less than 80% of the actual amount, the respondent was right to invoke his statutory powers to charge the tax as she did. Mr. Gugami's reaction was that the letter, if it was aiming at seeking extension of time to pay the tax due, it 2ps. ought to have been written in the relevant year of income, in this case the year 2014. Having been written in 2015, the letter was irrelevant and would not be treated as an application under section 79 (2) of the ITA, he insisted. 3ps. 1ps.

      - question: |
          What was the central issue considered in the case?

          What does section 99(1) of the ITA relate to?
        answer: |
          Section 99(1) of the ITA deals with 'Interest for Understating Tax Payable by Installments.'
      - question: |
          Why was the respondent justified in imposing the tax?
        answer: |
          The undisputed calculations showed that the installment tax paid was only 71.3% of the actual tax, which was below the required threshold of 80%. This gave the respondent the statutory authority to impose the tax.

          What was Mr. Mukebezi's argument regarding the letter dated January 7, 2015?
        answer: |

      - question: |
          Why was the letter written in 2015 deemed irrelevant by Mr. Gugami?
        answer: |
          Mr. Gugami argued that if the letter was intended to seek an extension of time to pay the tax, it should have been written in the relevant year of income (2014). Being written in 2015, it was irrelevant and not valid as an application under section 79(2) of the ITA.

      1ps. 1ps. In addition to the above dispute between the parties, there was yet another tax issue in the same year of income 2014, which was whether the respondent's decision to imposed underestimated interest of TZS. 730,534,130.30 was, in law, a correct action to take. This issue arose because there was in the year of income 2014 an underestimated taxable amount. The appellant's argument was that imposing the tax was 2ps. arbitrary because upon discovery of the error, in early January 2015, she wrote a letter contained at page 378 of the record of appeal, dated 7t h January 2015 informing the respondent of the anomaly but the latter did not respond to that letter. The Board heard parties on the two issues and finally resolved both in favour of the respondent. Being deeply aggrieved with the decision of the 3ps. Board, under section 16 (4) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act [Cap 408 R.E. 2002] (the TRAA), the appellant filed Tax Appeal No. 14 of 2020 in the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal). 2ps. 1ps. The appellant's argument was that imposing the tax was arbitrary because upon discovery of the error, in early January 2015, she wrote a letter contained at page 378 of the record of appeal, dated 7t h January 2015 informing the respondent of the anomaly but the latter did not respond to that letter. The Board heard parties on the two issues and finally resolved both in favour of 2ps. the respondent. The grounds upon which the appeal was based were a replica of its complaints that had been lodged in the Board and dismissed. The Tribunal heard the parties on the appeal and at the end, like the Board, it dismissed it in its entirety for want of merit.

      1ps. 1ps. In respect of Mr. Mukebezi's argument that CDEAL handed over customers to the appellant, we inquired from him whether CDEAL had identifiable customers that he had control over, such that, she (CDEAL) could hand them over to a third party like the appellant. Although his response was prolonged and mouthful, it was incomprehensible and non-directional. Nonetheless, we did not get it right from the appellant's side, as to why and 2ps. how would one company (CDEAL in this case), give customers to another company (the appellant in this case) at a price, while the giver had no verifiable pool of customers, upon whom she had clear mandate to command as from which cement company should those customers purchase the product. In this case, there was no proof that CDEAL had in possession of a specified market segment or a cluster of customers who she would hand over to the appellant, upon cessation of their marketing contract. 2ps. 1ps. What we remotely gathered from his submission was that the nature of the cement industry demands arrangement where an outgoing distributor like CDEAL needed to be compensated for loss of customers to whom he was supplying the cement during the time he was serving them. In this case, there was no proof that CDEAL had in possession of a specified market segment or a cluster of customers who she would hand over 2ps. to the appellant, upon cessation of their marketing contract.

          Why was Mr. Mukebeziâ€™s response deemed unclear?
        answer: |
          His response was described as prolonged, incomprehensible, and non-directional, leaving the inquiry unanswered.
      - question: |
          What skepticism arose regarding a company transferring customers to another company for a price?

          No, there was no proof that CDEAL had a specified market segment or cluster of customers that it could transfer to the appellant upon ending the marketing contract.
