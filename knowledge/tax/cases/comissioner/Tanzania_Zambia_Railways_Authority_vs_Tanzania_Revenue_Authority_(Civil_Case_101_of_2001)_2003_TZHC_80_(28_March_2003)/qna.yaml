Unfortunately the Income Tax Act, 1973 section 103 (1) has Included these to fall under word "money",; the S. 103 (l) "In this Act "money" Includes any debt, deposit or credit, any salary, wages and pensions payments and any other remuneration what so-ever." The issue before me is whether the Court should issue the Injunction restraining: the Respondents from attaching the Bank Accounts. The letter requiring the Branch Manager to effect the attachment was dated 21'[ February, 2003 2ps. which is a month ago. The application was filed Under O.xXI R.

After reading the provisions of governing both parties I have come to the conclusion that this matter should be addressed with a Sense of Equity, that is because ifthere is more delay then the object of the Injuction will be defeated. 2ps. 1ps.

  - context: |
      Injuction will be defeated. My reasoning is mainly centered on the rights of Employees whom I have addressed as Innocent Souls and not very much to threat of them striking as 2ps. presented by the learned Counsel. This becomes true because Employees in this Country mainly depend on their salaries or wages for their daily bread including families and dependants. I find therefore not proper to punish them on the negligence of their Employer. Borrowing the mind of Mapigano, J. when he dealt with exparte rulings in Tanzania Knitwear Ltd Shamshu V. Esmail [1989] TLR.48, he held that, Ex-parte Injuctions could only be granted in special circumstances i. e done in good faith. 3ps. 1ps.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What main argument is used to justify the defeat of the Injunction?
        answer: |
          The main argument is centered on the rights of employees, referred to as 'Innocent Souls,' who should not be punished for their employer's negligence as they depend on their salaries or wages for daily sustenance.
      - question: |
          What precedent does the reasoning in this context borrow from?
        answer: |
          The reasoning borrows from Mapigano, J.'s ruling in the case of Tanzania Knitwear Ltd Shamshu V. Esmail [1989] TLR.48, where it was held that ex-parte injunctions could only be granted in special circumstances if done in good faith.
      - question: |
          Why are employees specifically considered in granting the relief?

          Employees are considered because they rely on their salaries or wages for their daily bread, families, and dependents, making them vulnerable to harm if their financial stability is affected.

          Ex-parte injunctions are considered valid only in special circumstances and if they are done in good faith.
