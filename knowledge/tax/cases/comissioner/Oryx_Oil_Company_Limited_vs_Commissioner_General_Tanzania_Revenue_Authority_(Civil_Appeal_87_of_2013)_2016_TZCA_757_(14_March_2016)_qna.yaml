      1ps. 1ps. Submitting in support of the preliminary objection, Mr. Haule argued that the appeal is defective because the decree of the Tribunal (the Decree) is only signed by the Vice-Chairman while it ought to have been signed by both the Vice-Chairman and the members of the Tribunal (all members). For that reason, Mr. Haule argued, the decree contravenes the provisions of Rule 21 2ps. of the Tribunal Rules. To bolster his argument, he cited the decisions of this Court in which a similar issue was dealt with. The cases include Midcom Tanzania Limited v. Commissioner General (TRA), Civil Appeal No. 13 of 2011 and Mbeya Intertrade Company Limited v. The Commissioner General, Civil Appeal No. 68 'A' of 2010 (both unreported). Mr. Haule argued that the defects renders the appeal 3ps. incurably defective. On that submission, he prayed that the preliminary objection be upheld. In response, Mr. Matunda opposed the preliminary objection. He argued that Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules applies only to decisions of the Tribunal, not decrees. 2ps. 1ps. On that submission, he prayed that the preliminary objection be upheld. In response, Mr. Matunda opposed the preliminary objection.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What was Mr. Haule's primary argument for why the appeal is defective?
        answer: |

      - question: |
          Which legal provision did Mr. Haule claim was contravened by the Tribunalâ€™s decree?

          Mr. Haule claimed that the decree contravened the provisions of Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules.
      - question: |
          What cases did Mr. Haule cite to support his position?
        answer: |
          Mr. Haule cited the cases of Midcom Tanzania Limited v. Commissioner General (TRA), Civil Appeal No. 13 of 2011, and Mbeya Intertrade Company Limited v. The Commissioner General, Civil Appeal No. 68 'A' of 2010.

        answer: |
          Mr. Matunda argued that under Rule 23 of the Tribunal Rules, issuing a decree is mandatory only for the purpose of execution, and a decree is not part of the Tribunal's decision required by law to be signed and certified by all members.
  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. In all the cases, the Court held that a decree of the Tribunal which is not signed by all members renders the appeal incurably defective. Although it is true that Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules refers to a decision, a decree is, under Rule 24(3) of the Tribunal Rules, read together with Rule 96 (2) (e) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 2009, a necessary document which a record of appeal must contain. In the case of Pembe Flour Mills Limited v. Commissioner General, TRA, 2ps. Civil Appeal No. 50 of 2015 (unreported), this Court stated as follows: "In terms o f Rule 14(1) o f the Tax Revenue Appeals Rules, the quorum in the Tribunal shall be three members of whom one shall be the Chairman or Vice- Chairman. This means that a decree , just like a decision of Tribunal\ must be signed by all members of the Tribunal." 2ps. 1ps. To be valid therefore, like a decision of the Tribunal, a decree must be signed in the same manner as the decision from which it arises. In the case of Pembe Flour Mills Limited v. Commissioner General, TRA, Civil Appeal No. 50 of 2015 (unreported), this Court stated as follows: "In terms o f Rule 14(1) o f the Tax Revenue Appeals 2ps. Rules, the quorum in the Tribunal shall be three members of whom one shall be the Chairman or Vice- Chairman. Having so observed, the Court rejected the argument similar to the one made by Mr. Matunda, that only the decision of the Tribunal is required to be included in the record of appeal as one of the necessary documents for the appeal.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What renders an appeal incurably defective in the context of Tribunal decrees?
        answer: |
          An appeal is considered incurably defective if the decree of the Tribunal is not signed by all its members, as this signature is essential for the validity of the decree.
      - question: |
          What does Rule 24(3) of the Tribunal Rules indicate about decrees?
        answer: |
          Rule 24(3) of the Tribunal Rules, read together with Rule 96(2)(e) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 2009, designates a decree as a necessary document that must be included in the record of appeal.
      - question: |
          What is the required quorum for the Tribunal according to Rule 14(1) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Rules?
        answer: |
          The required quorum for the Tribunal is three members, one of whom must be either the Chairman or the Vice-Chairman.
      - question: |
          What was the Court's decision in the case of Pembe Flour Mills Limited v. Commissioner General, TRA regarding decrees?
        answer: |
          The Court held that both a decision and its corresponding decree must be signed by all Tribunal members to be valid, rejecting arguments claiming that only the decision needed to be included in the record of appeal.
      - question: |
          Why must a decree be signed in the same manner as a Tribunal's decision?
        answer: |
          A decree must be signed in the same manner as the Tribunal's decision because it arises from that decision and is subject to the same validity requirements.

      1ps. 1ps. As a general rule, a decision is held to have been given per incuriam if it is given in ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory provision or a binding authority. In the case of Kiriri Cotton Co. v. R.K. Dewani (1958) E.A. 239, the Eat African Court of Appeal quoted a passage in the judgment 2ps. of Sir Raymond Evershed, M.R. who stated the principle in Morelle Ltd v. Wakeling (1955)1 All E.R. 708 in the following words. This definition is not necessarily exhaustive, but cases not strictly within it which can properly be held to have been decided per incuriam must, in our judgment consistently with the stare decisis rule which is essential features of our law, be... of the rarest occurrence...." Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules 3ps. under which the preliminary objection was based states as follows: "21. 2ps. 1ps. "As a general rule, the only cases in which decisions should be held to have been given per in curiam are those of decisions given in ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory provisions or some authority binding on the Court concerned: so that in such case some part of the decision or some step in the reasoning on which it is based is found on that account, to be demonstrably wrong. Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules under which the 2ps. preliminary objection was based states as follows: "21. After conclusion of the hearing o f the evidence and submissions of the parties the tribunal shall, as soon as practicable make a decision in the presence of the parties or their advocates or representatives and shall cause a copy duly signed and certified by the members of the Tribunal which heard the appeal to be served on each party to the proceedings". 3ps.

          According to the context, how common are cases that fall outside the definition of per incuriam but are still classified as such?

      On  the  basis  of
         the  foregoing  reasons,  we  hereby  uphold  the  preliminary objection. 
         The appeal which is incompetent for want of a valid decree is  hereby struck
