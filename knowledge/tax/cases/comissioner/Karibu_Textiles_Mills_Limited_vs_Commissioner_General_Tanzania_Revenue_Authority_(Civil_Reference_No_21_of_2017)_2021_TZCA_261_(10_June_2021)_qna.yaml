Tanzania Zambia Railway Authority, Civil Reference No. 5 of 2011 (unreported), a decision of the Court restating the principles upon which a decision of single Justice can be examined in a reference. Secondly, the learned counsel contended that the learned single Justice rightly dismissed the application for the applicant's failure to account for each of the thirty 2ps. days of delay from 27t h March, 2017. We have examined the material on record and given a careful consideration to the written and oral submissions of the learned counsel for the parties on whether good cause was given in terms of Rule 10 of the Rules to warrant the enlargement of time sought. It is settled that extension of time is a matter of discretion on the part of the Court and that such discretion must be 3ps. exercised judiciously and flexibly with regard to the relevant facts of the particular case. 2ps. 1ps. For the respondent, Mr. Noah Tito, learned State Attorney, adopted the written submissions filed in opposition to the reference and made two points: First, he argued that the Court had jurisdiction to ascertain the facts and reasons adduced in support of an application so as to exercise its discretion judiciously and that the respondent's concession was not a bar to the Court's due consideration of the matter. Admittedly, it has not been 2ps. possible to lay down an invariable definition of good cause so as to guide the exercise of the Court's discretion.

          Why has it been difficult to define 'good cause' in the context of extension of time?

      1ps. 1ps. The mere fact that the respondent conceded to the application did not waive the learned single Justice's power as well as duty to ascertain the merits or otherwise of the application and come to his own conclusion as to whether the application had disclosed good cause. We have also examined the complaint that in his consideration of the matter, the learned single Justice brought up new matters on which he decided the application without affording the parties a hearing. It 2ps. is evident from page 6 through page 13 of the typed ruling that the learned single Justice determined the sole issue whether there was good cause for the delay involved, focusing his attention to the period of thirty days of delay that occurred after the applicant had obtained all the certified documents on 27t h March, 2017. This was plainly not a new issue raised by the learned single suo motu but one borne out of 3ps. the material before him. 2ps. 1ps. We have also examined the complaint that in his consideration of the matter, the learned single Justice brought up new matters on which he decided the application without affording the parties a hearing. With respect to Mr. Luhanga, this complaint flies in the face of the record.

He paid special attention to the averment in 2ps. paragraph 17 of the supporting affidavit that by 27t h March, 2017 the applicant had been supplied with all the required documents but that there was no explanation as to why the application before him was filed a month later. Accordingly, we answer the first issue in the negative.

Court were accomplished." Referring to a number of the decisions of the Court including Bushiri Hassan v. Latifa Lukio Mashayo, Civil Application No. 3 of 2007 (unreported) on the imperious requirement in an application for extension of time for each day of delay to be accounted for, the learned single Justice dismissed the application for the applicant's failure to account for a period of one month after she was supplied with all required documents for the intended appeal. 2ps. 1ps.

      1ps. 1ps. The applicant was supplied with a copy of the decree duly signed by members of the Board on 22n d March 2017 and with certified exhibits on 27t h March, 2017. Although at that point the applicant had a complete set of the required documents for appealing, she was already out of time, hence the application before the learned single Justice of the Court for extension 2ps. of time to institute the intended appeal.
