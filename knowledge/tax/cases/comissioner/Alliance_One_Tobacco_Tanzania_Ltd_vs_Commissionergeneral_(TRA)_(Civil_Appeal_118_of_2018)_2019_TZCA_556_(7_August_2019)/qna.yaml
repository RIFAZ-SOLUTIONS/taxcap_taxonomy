    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why does the taxpayer argue that disallowing inventory costs is incorrect?
        answer: |
          The taxpayer argues that disallowing inventory costs is incorrect because making a transfer pricing adjustment automatically adjusts the costs of inventory. Disallowing the inventory costs separately creates a double disallowance, which is improper from an accounting perspective.
      - question: |
          What justification does Mr. Adelard provide for disallowing inventory costs?
        answer: |
          Mr. Adelard argues that the disallowance of inventory costs was due to the appellant's failure to provide evidence of actual costs incurred and corresponding payments. TRA required appropriate invoices and proof of payments, which were not provided by the appellant.
      - question: |
          How does Mr. Adelard respond to the claim that transfer pricing adjustments affect inventory costs?
        answer: |
          Mr. Adelard states that the claim is incorrect because transfer pricing pertains to related party arrangements, while the direct sales in question involve local sales. Therefore, the two concepts do not go together from an accounting perspective.
      - question: |
          What evidence did the TRA require from the appellant to support the claimed inventory costs?
        answer: |
          The TRA required appropriate invoices to substantiate each cost and evidence of actual payments made. The appellant failed to provide this evidence.

          How does the issue of double disallowance relate to the taxpayer's perspective on accounting principles?
        answer: |
          The taxpayer argues that disallowing inventory costs separately constitutes a double disallowance because the costs are automatically adjusted as part of the transfer pricing adjustment. This, according to the taxpayer, violates proper accounting principles.
