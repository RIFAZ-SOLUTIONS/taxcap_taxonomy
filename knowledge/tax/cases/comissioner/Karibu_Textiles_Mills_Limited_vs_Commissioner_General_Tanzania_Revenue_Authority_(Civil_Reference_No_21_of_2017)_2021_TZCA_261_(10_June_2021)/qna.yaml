The mere fact that the respondent conceded to the application did not waive the learned single Justice's power as well as duty to ascertain the merits or otherwise of the application and come to his own conclusion as to whether the application had disclosed good cause. We have also examined the complaint that in his consideration of the matter, the learned single Justice brought up new matters on which he decided the application without affording the parties a hearing. It 2ps. is evident from page 6 through page 13 of the typed ruling that the learned single Justice determined the sole issue whether there was good cause for the delay involved, focusing his attention to the period of thirty days of delay that occurred after the applicant had obtained all the certified documents on 27t h March, 2017.
