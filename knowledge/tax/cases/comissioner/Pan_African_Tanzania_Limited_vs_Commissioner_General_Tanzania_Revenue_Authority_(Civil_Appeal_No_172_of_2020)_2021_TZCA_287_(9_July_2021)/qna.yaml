      1ps. 1ps. We are fortified in that account because in order to ascertain the meaning of a clause in a statute, courts must look at the whole statute, at what precedes and what succeeds and not merely the clause itself and also compare the clause with other parts of the law and the setting in which it occurs. If we can apply the rule therefore, the phrases 'other decisions' or 'omissions' must be of the same nature as tax decisions and not otherwise. This was emphasized in the case of PAN AFRICAN ENERGY TANZANIA LTD VS 2ps. COMMISSIONER GENERAL (TRA) (supra) whereby, having considered sections, 51 and 53 of TAA which makes cross reference to the effect that an appeal to the Board has to be in accordance with section 16 (1) of the TRAA we said: "...it is significantly discernible that an appeal to the Board is presently narrowed down to an objection decision of the CG made under the TAA. 2ps. 1ps. If we can apply the rule therefore, the phrases 'other decisions' or 'omissions' must be of the same nature as tax decisions and not otherwise. Thus, in the light of the unambiguous and plain language used in section 50 (1) of what is a tax decision, we are satisfied that, refusal to grant the waiver is excluded in the realm of what constitutes a tax decision and neither is it an objection decision. It is 2ps.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What rule must courts follow when interpreting the meaning of a clause in a statute?
        answer: |
          Courts must look at the whole statute, considering what precedes and follows the clause, comparing it with other parts of the law and the setting in which it occurs, rather than interpreting the clause in isolation.
      - question: |
          What is the significance of the case PAN AFRICAN ENERGY TANZANIA LTD VS COMMISSIONER GENERAL (TRA)?
        answer: |
          The case emphasized that an appeal to the Board is limited to objection decisions made by the CG under the TAA, as discerned from the plain language of relevant sections like 16(1) of the TRAA and sections 51 and 53 of the TAA.
      - question: |
          How should the phrases 'other decisions' or 'omissions' be interpreted in this context?
        answer: |
          The phrases 'other decisions' or 'omissions' must be of the same nature as tax decisions and not interpreted as referring to other types of decisions.
      - question: |
          Why is the refusal to grant a waiver excluded from being considered a tax decision?
        answer: |
          The refusal to grant a waiver is excluded because it falls outside the plain and unambiguous definition of what constitutes a tax decision or an objection decision under section 50(1).

        answer: |

      1ps. 1ps. We say so because: Firstly, in terms of section 50 (1) of the TAA, the respondent is mandated to make any tax decision including 'assessment' or 'other decision7 or 'omission' on a matter left to the discretion, judgment, direction, opinion, approval, consent, satisfaction or determination of the Commissioner General under a tax law that directly affects a person. It is glaring that the whole of section 50 2ps. defines and regulates tax decisions left to the discretion, judgment, direction, opinion, approval, consent, satisfaction or determination of the Commissioner General. In particular, under section 50 (1) of the TAA, the preposition ' including' between the phrases 'any tax decision' and Assessment' or 'other decision' or 'omission' means that the former is a larger group which embraces the latter. This is cemented by a 3ps. latin maxim of ejusdem generis rule which means 'of the same kind'. The rule requires that: where in a statute there are genera! words following particular specific words, the genera1 words must be confined to things of the same kind as those specifically mentioned. http://ca.Dracticallaw.thomsonreuters.com. 2ps. 1ps. The rule requires that: where in a statute there are genera! words following particular specific words, the genera1 words must be confined to things of the same kind as those specifically mentioned. http://ca.Dracticallaw.thomsonreuters.com.

In the same vein, in the absence of any inconsistencies in the provisions in question that the refusal to grant the waiver is neither a tax decision nor an objection decision which can be appealed against before the Board, we decline the appellant's counsel invitation to invoke the harmonious construction of the provisions in question. The objects and reasons among other things, included the 2ps. following: "Tangu kuanzishwa kwa Mamlaka ya Mapato pamoja na maboresho yaiiyofanyika, pamekuwa na ugumu wa utekelezaji wa sheria za kodi katika maeneo yafuatayo: - - (i) Not applicable. - (ii)Not applicable - (iii) Kuwepo kwa usumbufu kwa waiipa kodi unaotokana na taratibu za usimamizi na utawala zinazotofautiana kwa kifa aina ya kodi ambayo wakati mwingine husababisha waiipa kodi kupoteza haki zao za msingi biia sababu."
