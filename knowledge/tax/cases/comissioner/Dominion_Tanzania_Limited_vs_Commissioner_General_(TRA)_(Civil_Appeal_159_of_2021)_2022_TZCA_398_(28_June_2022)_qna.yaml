      1ps. 1ps. A similar position was taken in numerous cases. Mr. Mukebezi has invited the Court to rely on Pan African Energy Company Limited's case (supra) in which the Court while relying on the interpretation of section 9 (1 ) (vii) (c) of the Indian Income Tax Act had interpretated section 69 (i) (i) of the ITA 2004 to the effect that a private company had no obligation to withhold 2ps. tax if the services fees paid were for services rendered outside the country as in his view is a good law . However, we think, the position on this matter is now well settled following the decision in Tullow Tanzania BV (supra) where the Court interpreted the said provision and stated that: "It is our strong view that the word "rendered" used under section 69 (i) (i) is synonymous to words "supplied" or "delivered". In this regard, a non-resident has delivered / supplied services to a resident of the 3ps. United Republic of Tanzania. 2ps. 1ps.

[Emphasis added] Although in the opinion of the appellant the decision in Tullow Tanzania BV's case is bad law, on the contrary, it is our considered view that is correct position of the law to which we subscribe. We are mindful of the fact that M r.

It was advanced 2ps. in the cases of National Microfinance Bank Limited v. Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 168 of 2018 and Ophir Tanzania (Block 1) Limited v. Commissioner General Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 58 of 2020 (both unreported).
