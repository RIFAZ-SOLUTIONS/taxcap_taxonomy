The appeal before the Court does not contain a copy of a valid extracted order. We do not consider that the omission is a mere irregularity but it goes to the root of the appeal. Mr. Magongo appears to concede this legal position. The consequence of the appeal record lacking a valid order is drastic but inevitable. Although strictly speaking Order 20 rule 7 of the Civil Procedure 2ps. Act refers to a decree and not to an order, for the reasons which we have attempted to give, creating a parity between a decree and an order for the purpose of dating an order we sustained the third ground of Preliminary Objection and struck out the appeal with costs.
