That means that the respondent could not have made an objection decision capable of being appealed from in terms of section 16(1) of the TRAA. Contrary to the learned advocate, we do not think 2ps. he is correct in submitting as he did that the Court took a narrow approach in excluding other decisions and omissions from the realm of appellable decisions.

From the contentions in that appeal, the Board framed one main issue for its determination, that is to say; whether the respondent's decision demanding payment from the appellant without lodging an application for execution was lawful. Although the respondent's reply to the statement of appeal did not raise any issue touching on the jurisdiction of the Board, such an issue arose as an alternative argument in the respondent's written submissions in reply. Nevertheless, the Board took the view that it 2ps. had jurisdiction to determine the appeal under the Tax Administration Act, 2015 (the TAA) considering that section 7 of TRAA vests in it sole jurisdiction in all proceedings of a civil nature in disputes arising from revenue laws administered by Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA). Regarding the merit of the appeal, the Board sustained the respondent's argument that the demand for payment of the tax due dated 11/05/2017 from 3ps. the respondent was made in the exercise of his statutory powers of administering the TAA the legality of which was being challenged by the appellant. 2ps. 1ps.

It held that it was legally proper for the respondent to demand payment of the tax 2ps. due without recourse to the Tribunal by way of an application for execution. The Board relied on the decision of the Tribunal in Tullow Tanzania BV v. Commissioner General, TRA, Tax Appeal No.
