      repair the vessel which must have been in August 1991 when the respondent found his 2ps. vessel to have been in a dilapidated state. Suits founded on contract have to be filed within 6 years as per item 7 of the Schedule to the Law of Limitation Act. We observe also that the respondent very conveniently did not mention the exact date in December 1996 when he allegedly found his vessel missing. There is no gainsaying that in computing period of limitation every single day counts. If it were to be assumed for example 3ps. that the cause of action of the suit founded on tort arose in December 1996 then the period of limitation would end in December 1999. The plaint here was filed on 30.12.1999. 3ps. 1ps. We observe also that the respondent very conveniently did not mention the exact date in December 1996 when he allegedly found his vessel missing.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the time limit for filing suits founded on a contract according to the Law of Limitation Act?
        answer: |
          Suits founded on a contract must be filed within 6 years as per item 7 of the Schedule to the Law of Limitation Act.
      - question: |
          Why is the exact date in December 1996 significant in this case?
        answer: |
          The exact date in December 1996 is significant because it determines when the cause of action for the missing vessel arose, which affects whether the plaint filed on 30.12.1999 was within the limitation period.
      - question: |
          What is the implication of the principle that 'every single day counts' in computing the period of limitation?
        answer: |
          The principle implies that the period of limitation is calculated precisely, and even a single day’s delay can render the filing of a suit inadmissible if it is outside the specified timeframe.
      - question: |
          When would the limitation period have expired if the cause of action arose in December 1996?
        answer: |
          If the cause of action arose in December 1996, the limitation period would have expired in December 1999.
      - question: |
          What issue does the court highlight regarding the date of the cause of action for the missing vessel?
        answer: |
          The court highlights the issue that the respondent did not provide the exact date in December 1996 when the vessel was allegedly found missing, making it unclear whether the suit was filed within the limitation period.
