The respondent contended that in the absence of the Commissioner's permission under section 56 (1) (a) of the EACCMA, which permission was refused, there wouldn't be any abandonment of the goods.

    questions_and_answers:

        answer: |

      1ps. 1ps. However, the above position of the law notwithstanding, we have observed the following in relation to this complaint. It is on record that, the goods were examined and found to have complied with all customs requirements and fit for human consumption before they were cleared to the bonded warehouse pending payment of duties and taxes. Hie goods expired because they overstayed in the bonded warehouse as the appellant failed to pay the taxes within the prescribed period. The record further shows that the 2ps. appellant communicated with the manufacturer concerning the said goods who confirmed them to be fit for human consumption. Thus, if at ali the appellant intended to abandon them it was because he wanted to preserve the brand and not otherwise. In the circumstances, she ought to have followed the proper procedure to get the Commissioner's permission as stated above. Since there was no such permission, it cannot be said with certainty that the 3ps. goods were abandoned as correctly, in our view, decided by the Tribunal. This ground too fails. 2ps. 1ps. In the circumstances, she ought to have followed the proper procedure to get the Commissioner's permission as stated above. Since there was no such permission, it cannot be said with certainty that the goods were abandoned as correctly, in our view, decided by the Tribunal. This ground too fails. Before we conclude, we would like to say something about the issue raised by the appellant '' whether there 2ps. is no iaw which empowers the Commissioner to charge duties and taxes on goods which are still in the customs control". We have considered this matter and we are in agreement with the respondent that this is a new issue which was never raised and dealt with by the Board and the Tribunal.

      - question: |
          What was the reason the goods expired while in the bonded warehouse?
        answer: |
          The goods expired because they overstayed in the bonded warehouse as the appellant failed to pay the taxes within the prescribed period.
      - question: |
          What did the manufacturer confirm regarding the expired goods?
        answer: |
          The manufacturer confirmed that the expired goods were fit for human consumption.
      - question: |
          What procedure should the appellant have followed if intending to abandon the goods?
        answer: |
          The appellant should have followed the proper procedure by obtaining the Commissioner's permission before abandoning the goods.
      - question: |
          Why did the Tribunal reject the claim that the goods were abandoned?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal rejected the claim because there was no evidence of permission from the Commissioner to abandon the goods, making it uncertain that the goods were legally abandoned.
      - question: |
          Why did the Tribunal dismiss the issue raised by the appellant about charging duties on goods still under customs control?
        answer: |
          The Tribunal dismissed the issue because it was a new issue that had not been raised or dealt with by the Board or the Tribunal previously.

      1ps. 1ps. For ease of reference, we shall reproduce this provision of law as follows: - "57. - (3) Where any goods are sold under the provisions of this section, then the proceeds of such sale shall be applied in the order set out beiow in the discharge of- - (a) the duties; - (b) the expenses of the sale; - (c) any rent and charges due to the Customs or to the warehouse keeper; - (d) the port charges; and - (e) the freight and any other 2ps. charges." (Emphasis ours). While the appellant took refuge under this provision that the goods were abandoned, our understanding of the same is that the provision relates to sale by public auction of the goods which have not been re­ warehoused and how the proceeds of the sale are distributed. The provision does not at alt deal with the abandonment of goods as claimed by the appellant. Furthermore, as correctly stated by the Tribunal, the said provision 3ps. contemplates a situation where the goods are not re-warehoused and are commercially viable. 2ps. 1ps.

The provision does not at alt deal with the abandonment of goods as claimed by the appellant. Furthermore, as correctly stated by the Tribunal, the said provision contemplates a 2ps. situation where the goods are not re-warehoused and are commercially viable. The situation is different in the case at hand because the goods in question were not commercially viable.

          What does section 57, subsection (3) of the provision address?
        answer: |
          Section 57, subsection (3) addresses the sale of goods by public auction when the goods are not re-warehoused, and it outlines the order of distribution for the proceeds of such a sale.
      - question: |
          What is the correct order of distribution for the proceeds from the sale under this provision?

      - question: |
          Why did the appellant attempt to rely on this provision, and how was it interpreted by the Tribunal?
        answer: |
          The appellant claimed the provision allowed for the abandonment of goods, but the Tribunal interpreted it to only relate to the sale of goods by auction when they are not re-warehoused and commercially viable, not to abandonment.
      - question: |
          What key condition must be met for this provision to apply to goods?
        answer: |
          The goods in question must not be re-warehoused and must be commercially viable for the provision to apply.
      - question: |
          Why was the provision deemed inapplicable to the case at hand?
        answer: |
