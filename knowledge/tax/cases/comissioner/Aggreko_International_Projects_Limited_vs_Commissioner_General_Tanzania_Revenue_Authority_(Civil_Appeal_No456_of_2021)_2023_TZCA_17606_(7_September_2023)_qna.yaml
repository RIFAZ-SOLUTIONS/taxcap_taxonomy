The learned counsel further argued that, the Tribunal erred in holding that the Board correctly applied section 11 (2) of the Act. 2ps. He also challenged the Tribunal for agreeing with the respondent that the allocation of costs by AIPL to the appellant was not at arm's length which was contradictory because the requirements of arm's length allocation of costs is applicable under section 33 (1) of the Act and not section 11 (2) of the Act and further to that, the cost plus method which the Tribunal applied as a basis of disallowance instead of 3ps. the turnover method applied by the appellant is not indicated under section 11 (2) of the Act but rather is one of the transfer pricing method used to test arm's length pricing of transaction between associates in terms of paragraph 2.45 of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. 2ps. 1ps.

        answer: |
          Mr. Kileo contended that the Tribunal erred by failing to consider section 33 (1) of the Act and the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines in determining the correctness of the respondent's decision to disallow head office costs.
