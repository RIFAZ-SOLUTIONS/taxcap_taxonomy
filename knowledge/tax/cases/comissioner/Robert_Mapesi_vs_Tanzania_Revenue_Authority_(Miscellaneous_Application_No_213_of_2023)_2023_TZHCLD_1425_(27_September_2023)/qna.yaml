      account for the delay as it was held case of Lyamuya Construction Co. Ltd vs Board of Registered Trustee 4ps. of ## Young Women's Christian Association of Tanzania, Civil Application No. 2 of 2010 [2011] TZCA 4 and Finca T. Limited &amp; Another vs Boniface Mwalukisa (Civil Application 589 of 2018) [2019] TZCA 561 cited by counsel for the applicant and the respondent respectively. 4ps. 1ps. It was deponed by the applicant that she was supplied with a copy of Ruling of the Court of Appeal striking out Revision Application No. 310/18 of 2020 on 14 th July 2023 and that, the days from 14 th July 2023 to 18 th July 2023, were spent in preparation and filing this application. In fact, there is no contention on that. There is a plethora of case laws that, the delay even of 2ps. a single day, must be accounted for. See Mwalukisa's case (supra), Hyansitha Malisa vs John Malisa (Civil Application 167 of 2021) [2023] TZCA 239 and Tanzania Local Government Workers Union (TALGWU) vs Sospeter Gallus Omollo (Civil Application No.311/18 of 2022) [2023] TZCA 17486 to mention just a few. As pointed hereinabove, applicant did not account for seven days from 18 th July 2023 to 25 th 3ps. July 2023. With that failure, I find that there is no justification for this court to extend time. For the foregoing and in the up short, I dismiss this application for
