  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. That is the situation in the instant case. The Certificate o f Incentives issued to the applicant has no mention of VAT. That being the position, I think that it would be overzealous to hold that the applicant has shown a prima facie case with a probability of success. As to the question of irreparable loss, I do 2ps. not think that there can be envisaged such loss to the applicant as would not be compensated by an award of damages. It is also not impertinent to add here that in addition to the principles enunciated above, when temporary injunctions are sought to be made against public authorities charged with the duty of collecting public revenue, such application must not 3ps. be lightly granted by the courts. While the courts are duty-bound to protect the innocent public against abuse of power by tax authorities, the courts must not be oblivious of public policy. My learned brother Judge, Katiti, ./. expressed a similar view, if not even more candidly, in the case of Mufindi Tea Co.'JAmited 2ps. 1ps. While the courts are duty-bound to protect the innocent public against abuse of power by tax authorities, the courts must not be oblivious of public policy. My learned brother Judge, Katiti, ./. expressed a similar view, if not even more candidly, in the case of Mufindi Tea Co.'JAmited v. Tanzania Revenue Authority, (Dar es Salaam Miscellaneous Civil Cause No. 139 o f 2ps. 1999 - as yet unreported) in which he said: ' Tax collection, even if mistaken, being a statutory duty, mandated to be done by the respondent differences emerging from differing interpretations, I cannot see any wrong, that would attract a temporary injunction.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What does the Certificate of Incentives fail to mention in the instant case?
        answer: |
          The Certificate of Incentives issued to the applicant fails to mention VAT.
      - question: |
          Why did the court conclude that the applicant did not have a prima facie case with a probability of success?
        answer: |
          The court concluded this because the Certificate of Incentives did not mention VAT, making it unlikely the applicant could show a strong, probable case for success.
      - question: |
          What reasoning did the court provide regarding the potential for irreparable loss to the applicant?
        answer: |
          The court reasoned that any loss to the applicant could be compensated by an award of damages, thus irreparable loss was not envisaged.
      - question: |
          What caution did the court give regarding granting temporary injunctions against public authorities?
        answer: |
          The court cautioned that temporary injunctions against public authorities charged with collecting public revenue should not be granted lightly, balancing the need to protect the public and maintain public policy.
      - question: |
          What precedent did Judge Katiti reference regarding temporary injunctions and tax collection disputes?
        answer: |
          Judge Katiti referenced the case of Mufindi Tea Co. Limited v. Tanzania Revenue Authority, stating that tax collection, even if mistaken, is a statutory duty, and differences stemming from interpretations do not justify a temporary injunction.
