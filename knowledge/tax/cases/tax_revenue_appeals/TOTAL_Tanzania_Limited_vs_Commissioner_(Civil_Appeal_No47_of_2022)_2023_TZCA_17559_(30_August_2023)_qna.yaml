      1ps. 1ps. - 3. The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law by failing to hold that in terms of Chapter 1 of Annex B of the World Customs Organization Protocol of2008, the fuel imported by the appellant was not for home consumption. On 16th August, 2023 when this appeal was called on for hearing, the appellant company was represented by Mr. Alan Kileo, learned counsel whereas the respondent had the services of Mr. 2ps. Hospias Maswanyia, learned Senior State Attorney. One, that JET A1 imported by the appellant and sold to international airlines is non RDL taxable and two, that the act of the respondent to impose RDL under the circumstances was in total ignorance and in violation of fundamental principles of taxation. The appellant's counsel amplified further that, the appellant's wisdom guided him to declare JET A1 for home consumption because other available options such as on transit, for export or for temporary 3ps. use were not feasible under the circumstances. 2ps. 1ps. At the inception of his submission in support of the appeal, Mr. Kileo adopted his written submission filed earlier on and thereafter submitted all the grounds of appeal in two-fold. One, that JET A1 imported by the appellant and sold to international airlines is non RDL taxable and two, that the act of the respondent to impose RDL under the circumstances was in total ignorance and in violation of fundamental principles 2ps. of taxation. He thus faulted both the TRAT and TRAB to base tax liability on that declaration because, to him, that will not change the fact that the fuel was not used in Tanzania.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What was the central legal issue in the appeal regarding the taxation of JET A1 fuel?
        answer: |
          The central legal issue was whether JET A1 fuel imported by the appellant and sold to international airlines should be subject to RDL taxation, given that it was not for home consumption and was used outside Tanzania.
      - question: |
          Who represented the appellant and the respondent during the hearing on August 16, 2023?
        answer: |
          The appellant was represented by Mr. Alan Kileo, a learned counsel, while the respondent was represented by Mr. Hospias Maswanyia, a learned Senior State Attorney.
      - question: |
          What argument did the appellant make regarding the declaration of JET A1 fuel for 'home consumption'?
        answer: |
          The appellant argued that the declaration of JET A1 fuel for 'home consumption' was made because other available options such as 'on transit,' 'for export,' or 'for temporary use' were not feasible under the given circumstances.
      - question: |
          Why did the appellant's counsel assert that imposing RDL tax violated fundamental principles of taxation?
        answer: |
          The appellant's counsel asserted that imposing RDL tax violated fundamental principles of taxation because the JET A1 fuel was not used within Tanzania, making it inappropriate to classify it as taxable for home consumption.
      - question: |
          What fault did the appellant's counsel find in the rulings of the TRAT and TRAB?
        answer: |
          The appellant's counsel faulted the TRAT and TRAB for basing tax liability on the declaration of 'home consumption,' arguing that it did not alter the fact that the fuel was ultimately not used in Tanzania.
  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. With respect, we do not find the appellant's counsel's explanation plausible as he intimated in his written submissions that he was forced to declare JET A1 for home consumption out of the available tax declarations mechanisms because the Tanzania Customs Integration System (TANCIS) was not configured to charge RDL. We found this wanting. The appellant made a choice out of available options, as such, he is estopped to decline. TANCIS is a system and RDL is chargeable by operation 2ps. of the law, it is inconceivable to hold that the appellant was forced to declare JET A1 for home consumption while in his mind the intention was for something else. This is an afterthought. Since we ruled out that JET A1 was not cargo for export purposes, then we hold such a consignment to be for home consumption. The reason would be that the appellant did not submit what was the consignment for if not for taxation purposes on what was declared. 2ps. 1ps. This is an afterthought. Since we ruled out that JET A1 was not cargo for export purposes, then we hold such a consignment to be for home consumption. The reason would be that the appellant did not submit what was the consignment for if not for taxation purposes on what was declared. We hold so because the appellant simply alleged that the mode "for home consumption" was deployed for that was the only suitable way of declaring goods for tax purposes. We find 2ps. this to be a narrow approach of the way facts are comprehended. This therefore resolves ground one of the appeal which we find unmerited.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What reasoning did the appellant's counsel provide for declaring JET A1 for home consumption?
        answer: |
          The appellant's counsel argued that he was forced to declare JET A1 for home consumption because the Tanzania Customs Integration System (TANCIS) was not configured to charge RDL.
      - question: |
          Why did the court find the appellant's explanation regarding TANCIS unconvincing?
        answer: |
          The court found it unconvincing because TANCIS is a system and RDL is chargeable by law, making it inconceivable that the appellant was forced to declare JET A1 for home consumption against their true intent.
      - question: |
          What conclusion did the court reach about the purpose of the JET A1 consignment?
        answer: |

          What did the court label the appellant's claim regarding the use of the 'home consumption' mode?
        answer: |
          The court labeled the appellant's claim as an afterthought and found this reasoning to be a narrow interpretation of the available options.
      - question: |
          What was the final decision of the court on the first ground of appeal?
        answer: |
          The court resolved the first ground of appeal as unmerited.

      1ps. 1ps. For clarity, we reproduce the said section as hereunder: - 34 (1) Save as otherwise provided in the customs laws, the whoie of the cargo of an aircraft, vehicle or vessel which is unloaded or to be unloaded shall be entered by the owner within twenty-one days after the commencement of discharge or in the case of vehicles on arrival or such further period as may be allowed by the proper officer either for- - (a) Home consumption. - (b) Warehousing. Our interpretation of the quoted 2ps. section above is that, unless what is in the aircraft, vehicle or vessel is a cargo, it cannot be anything other than for home consumption making the quoted section inapplicable. We interpreted so as in the instant tax dispute, JET A1 fueled in international aircraft is not a cargo for it was not loaded or meant to be unloaded in those aircrafts. Having ruled out on the import of section 34 of the EACCMA, we now turn to the crux of the matter, that is whether the declared JET A1 does not 3ps. attract RDL. 2ps. 1ps. Our interpretation of the quoted section above is that, unless what is in the aircraft, vehicle or vessel is a cargo, it cannot be anything other than for home consumption making the quoted section inapplicable. We interpreted so as in the instant tax dispute, JET A1 fueled in international aircraft is not a cargo for it was not loaded or meant to be unloaded in those aircrafts. The appellant averment on this is that, the respondent wrongly subjected JET A1 to RDL basing on the declaration made 2ps. that it is for home consumption.

          What is the requirement under Section 34(1) of the customs laws regarding cargo unloading?
        answer: |

      - question: |
          Why is Section 34 deemed inapplicable in the tax dispute regarding JET A1 fuel?
        answer: |
          Section 34 is deemed inapplicable because the JET A1 fuel is not considered 'cargo' as it was not loaded onto or meant to be unloaded from the international aircraft.
      - question: |
          What was the crux of the tax dispute related to JET A1 fuel?
        answer: |
          The crux of the tax dispute was whether the declared JET A1 fuel attracts RDL (Railway Development Levy).
      - question: |
          Why did the appellant argue that JET A1 should not attract RDL?
        answer: |
          The appellant argued that the respondent wrongly subjected JET A1 to RDL based on a declaration that it was for home consumption, despite it not being cargo.
      - question: |
          What interpretation was made about goods not classified as 'cargo' under the customs laws?
        answer: |
          The interpretation was that goods not classified as 'cargo' cannot be considered for anything other than home consumption under Section 34, thereby making the section inapplicable to such goods.

      1ps. 1ps. The learned counsel concluded by submitting that, the appellant's move of borrowing a leaf from "the Convention" on the definition of the phrase goods in free circulation is unnecessary because, the definition provided for under the provisions of section 2(2) of the EACCMA suffices and is exhaustive on that aspect. He thus implored us to consider the declared JET Al subject to RDL under section 20(A) of the Railways Act. It is following that declaration, 2ps. as said, is when the respondent imposed RDL at the tune of TZS 436,459,459.00. As stated earlier, which also parties are at one, is that, RDL is levied under the provisions of section 20A of the Railways Act as of 1s t July, 2015. Parties however parted their ways on one aspect which gave rise to the issue as to whether the declared JET A1 for 3ps. home consumption is non-exempt or exempted from RDL.
