Submitting in rebuttal on the issue, Ms. Kinyaka who made the submissions for the respondent supported the decision of the Tribunal that a certificate of incentive is an agreement between the Government and the investor.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What argument did Ms. Kinyaka present to support the Tribunal's decision regarding the certificate of incentive?
        answer: |
          Ms. Kinyaka argued that a certificate of incentive is an agreement between the Government and the investor, citing section 17(7) of the TTA and the principle in the Vodacom Tanzania Public Limited Company vs. Commissioner General, TRA case for support.
      - question: |
          Why did Ms. Kinyaka disagree with the appellants' claim about the Attorney General's involvement?
        answer: |
          Ms. Kinyaka disagreed with the appellants' claim by referring to section 5(2)(c) of the HA, which indicates that the Attorney General is part of the TIC. She argued that the appellant had the burden of proving the Attorney General's non-involvement.
      - question: |
          What stance did Mr. Kinabo take regarding the certificate of incentive?
        answer: |
          Mr. Kinabo maintained that a certificate of incentive is not an agreement and urged the Court not to rely on the Vodacom case, stating that it involved a different issue pertaining to the Income Tax Act.
      - question: |
          What was the significance of section 5(2)(c) of the HA in the dispute?
        answer: |
          Section 5(2)(c) of the HA was significant because Ms. Kinyaka used it to argue that the Attorney General, as part of the TIC, was inherently involved in matters related to the certificate of incentive, countering the appellants' claims.
      - question: |
          Why did Mr. Kinabo object to the use of the Vodacom Tanzania case as a precedent?
        answer: |
          Mr. Kinabo objected to its use because the issue in that case related to the Income Tax Act, which he argued was different from the issue in the current dispute regarding the certificate of incentive.
