      1ps. 1ps. Eventually, the respondent issued three withholding tax certificates demanding a total sum of TZS. 346,492,916.00 for the period 2013 to 2016. Following an unsuccessful objection against the demand, the appellant appealed to the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board). The respondent's stance was that the DTA had no avail to the appellant in so far as the service fees paid to a foreign consultant was outside the scope of Article 7 of the DTA because it did not 2ps. form part of its business profits and thus liable to withholding tax in Tanzania. In its decision, the Board sustained the respondent's position. It held that the service fees were not embraced in the definition of business profits of the payee in the carrying of its business neither did it fall under any of the categories of the specific articles in the DTA. 2ps. 1ps.

      1ps. 1ps. The Court took a different view. It endorsed the Tribunal's decision which had held that the service fees were outside the scope of Article 7 (1) rather, Article 20 of the DTA. Few months later, a similar issue involving a dispute on the liability to withholding tax by another South African entity which had rendered services to a Tanzanian entity, arose in Mantra (Tanzania) Limited (supra). The Court reaffirmed its position 2ps. in Kilombero and dismissed Mantra's argument for being untenable.

As 2ps. seen earlier, the OECD Commentary in the Materials on International TP and EU Tax Law and International Tax Policy and Double Tax Treaties (supra) were placed by Kilombero's counsel to persuade the Court accept the argument that the service fee was not liable to withholding tax it was caught up by Article 7 (1) of the DTA. The Court felt unmoved to interpret the DTA 3ps. in line with the learned counsel for the appellant in that appeal.

      1ps. 1ps. Mr. Ngowi could not mince words responding to the Court's question on the correctness of the approach he was championing in the light of the decision in Kilombero Sugar Company Limited v. Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 218 of 2019 (unreported). He was unrelenting in his oral address that the decision was erroneous. Justifying his standpoint, the learned advocate contended that the 2ps. Court's attention was not drawn to the OECD commentaries on the relevant Articles from the OECD Model Tax Convention from which the DTA traces its route as a result of which the Court gave a narrow view in interpreting the DTA.
