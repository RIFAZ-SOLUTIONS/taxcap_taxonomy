      1ps. 1ps. - 3. The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law by failing to hold that in terms of Chapter 1 of Annex B of the World Customs Organization Protocol of2008, the fuel imported by the appellant was not for home consumption. On 16th August, 2023 when this appeal was called on for hearing, the appellant company was represented by Mr. Alan Kileo, learned counsel whereas the respondent had the services of Mr. 2ps. Hospias Maswanyia, learned Senior State Attorney. One, that JET A1 imported by the appellant and sold to international airlines is non RDL taxable and two, that the act of the respondent to impose RDL under the circumstances was in total ignorance and in violation of fundamental principles of taxation. The appellant's counsel amplified further that, the appellant's wisdom guided him to declare JET A1 for home consumption because other available options such as on transit, for export or for temporary 3ps. use were not feasible under the circumstances. 2ps. 1ps. At the inception of his submission in support of the appeal, Mr. Kileo adopted his written submission filed earlier on and thereafter submitted all the grounds of appeal in two-fold. One, that JET A1 imported by the appellant and sold to international airlines is non RDL taxable and two, that the act of the respondent to impose RDL under the circumstances was in total ignorance and in violation of fundamental principles 2ps. of taxation. He thus faulted both the TRAT and TRAB to base tax liability on that declaration because, to him, that will not change the fact that the fuel was not used in Tanzania.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What was the primary legal issue in the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal case mentioned?
        answer: |
          The primary legal issue was whether the JET A1 fuel imported by the appellant and sold to international airlines was subject to RDL tax and whether declaring the fuel for 'home consumption' was appropriate under the circumstances.
      - question: |
          Who represented the appellant and the respondent during the appeal hearing on August 16, 2023?
        answer: |
          The appellant was represented by Mr. Alan Kileo, learned counsel, while the respondent was represented by Mr. Hospias Maswanyia, a learned Senior State Attorney.
      - question: |
          What were the two key arguments presented by the appellant's counsel in their appeal?
        answer: |
          The two key arguments were: first, that JET A1 imported and sold to international airlines is non-RDL taxable, and second, that the respondent's imposition of RDL violated fundamental principles of taxation.
      - question: |
          Why did the appellant declare JET A1 fuel for 'home consumption' according to their counsel?
        answer: |
          The appellant's counsel stated that declaring JET A1 for 'home consumption' was the only feasible option, as other alternatives, such as marking it as 'in transit,' 'for export,' or 'for temporary use,' were not suitable under the circumstances.
      - question: |
          What was the appellant's critique of the TRAT and TRAB’s decision regarding tax liability?
        answer: |
          The appellant's counsel argued that the TRAT and TRAB erred in basing tax liability on the declaration of 'home consumption,' as it did not change the fact that the fuel was not actually used in Tanzania.
  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. With respect, we do not find the appellant's counsel's explanation plausible as he intimated in his written submissions that he was forced to declare JET A1 for home consumption out of the available tax declarations mechanisms because the Tanzania Customs Integration System (TANCIS) was not configured to charge RDL. We found this wanting. The appellant made a choice out of available options, as such, he is estopped to decline. TANCIS is a system and RDL is chargeable by operation 2ps. of the law, it is inconceivable to hold that the appellant was forced to declare JET A1 for home consumption while in his mind the intention was for something else. This is an afterthought. Since we ruled out that JET A1 was not cargo for export purposes, then we hold such a consignment to be for home consumption. The reason would be that the appellant did not submit what was the consignment for if not for taxation purposes on what was declared. 2ps. 1ps. This is an afterthought. Since we ruled out that JET A1 was not cargo for export purposes, then we hold such a consignment to be for home consumption. The reason would be that the appellant did not submit what was the consignment for if not for taxation purposes on what was declared. We hold so because the appellant simply alleged that the mode "for home consumption" was deployed for that was the only suitable way of declaring goods for tax purposes. We find 2ps. this to be a narrow approach of the way facts are comprehended. This therefore resolves ground one of the appeal which we find unmerited.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What explanation did the appellant's counsel provide for declaring JET A1 for home consumption?
        answer: |
          The appellant's counsel explained that JET A1 was declared for home consumption because the Tanzania Customs Integration System (TANCIS) was not configured to charge the Railway Development Levy (RDL).
      - question: |
          Why did the court find the appellant's explanation regarding the declaration of JET A1 unpersuasive?
        answer: |
          The court found the explanation unpersuasive because the appellant had other declaration options but chose to declare the consignment for home consumption, and it was deemed an afterthought when the intention was argued to be otherwise.
      - question: |
          What was the court’s reasoning for concluding JET A1 was for home consumption?
        answer: |
          The court concluded that JET A1 was for home consumption because the appellant did not provide any alternative explanation for the consignment's purpose other than for taxation as declared.
      - question: |
          How did the court view the appellant's claim about the 'home consumption' mode being the only option?
        answer: |
          The court viewed this claim as a narrow and insufficient approach to comprehending the facts, rejecting it as a valid justification.
      - question: |
          What was the court's final decision on the first ground of appeal?
        answer: |
          The court resolved the first ground of the appeal as unmerited.
  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. For clarity, we reproduce the said section as hereunder: - 34 (1) Save as otherwise provided in the customs laws, the whoie of the cargo of an aircraft, vehicle or vessel which is unloaded or to be unloaded shall be entered by the owner within twenty-one days after the commencement of discharge or in the case of vehicles on arrival or such further period as may be allowed by the proper officer either for- - (a) Home consumption. - (b) Warehousing. Our interpretation of the quoted 2ps. section above is that, unless what is in the aircraft, vehicle or vessel is a cargo, it cannot be anything other than for home consumption making the quoted section inapplicable. We interpreted so as in the instant tax dispute, JET A1 fueled in international aircraft is not a cargo for it was not loaded or meant to be unloaded in those aircrafts. Having ruled out on the import of section 34 of the EACCMA, we now turn to the crux of the matter, that is whether the declared JET A1 does not 3ps. attract RDL. 2ps. 1ps. Our interpretation of the quoted section above is that, unless what is in the aircraft, vehicle or vessel is a cargo, it cannot be anything other than for home consumption making the quoted section inapplicable. We interpreted so as in the instant tax dispute, JET A1 fueled in international aircraft is not a cargo for it was not loaded or meant to be unloaded in those aircrafts. The appellant averment on this is that, the respondent wrongly subjected JET A1 to RDL basing on the declaration made 2ps. that it is for home consumption.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the specified time period within which the owner must enter the cargo after the commencement of discharge?
        answer: |
          According to the customs laws, the owner must enter the cargo within twenty-one days after the commencement of discharge or, in the case of vehicles, upon arrival.
      - question: |
          Under what two purposes can cargo be entered according to the customs laws?
        answer: |
          Cargo can be entered either for home consumption or for warehousing as specified in the customs laws.
      - question: |
          Why does the quoted section about cargo not apply to JET A1 in the tax dispute?
        answer: |
          The section does not apply to JET A1 because it is not considered cargo; it was neither loaded onto nor meant to be unloaded from the international aircraft.
      - question: |
          What argument did the appellant make regarding the application of RDL to JET A1?
        answer: |
          The appellant argued that the respondent wrongly subjected JET A1 to RDL based on its declaration for home consumption.
      - question: |
          How does the interpretation of 'cargo' impact the tax dispute over JET A1 fuel?
        answer: |
          The interpretation of 'cargo' excludes JET A1 fuel since it was not loaded or meant to be unloaded from the aircraft, making the quoted section inapplicable and central to the dispute over whether RDL should apply.

      1ps. 1ps. The learned counsel concluded by submitting that, the appellant's move of borrowing a leaf from "the Convention" on the definition of the phrase goods in free circulation is unnecessary because, the definition provided for under the provisions of section 2(2) of the EACCMA suffices and is exhaustive on that aspect. He thus implored us to consider the declared JET Al subject to RDL under section 20(A) of the Railways Act. It is following that declaration, 2ps. as said, is when the respondent imposed RDL at the tune of TZS 436,459,459.00. As stated earlier, which also parties are at one, is that, RDL is levied under the provisions of section 20A of the Railways Act as of 1s t July, 2015. Parties however parted their ways on one aspect which gave rise to the issue as to whether the declared JET A1 for 3ps. home consumption is non-exempt or exempted from RDL. The TRAT, so was the TRAB, interpreted the provisions of section 20A of the Railways Act and Section 2(2) of the EACCMA thus subjected JET A1 to RDL. 2ps. 1ps. Having heard from the parties and upon our consideration of the entire record, we find to be uncontested that, the appellant imported JET A l in Tanzania; declared the consignment for home consumption and sold to international aircrafts of various destinations commencing their trips from Tanzania Mainland. The TRAT, so was the TRAB, interpreted the provisions of section 20A of the Railways Act and Section 2(2) of the EACCMA thus 2ps. subjected JET A1 to RDL. For clarity, we reproduce the relevant provisions as hereunder: 20 A (1) There shall be charged a levy known as Railway Development Levy. 3ps. 1ps.

  ### Document Outline
  This document is a legal judgment from the Court of Appeal of Tanzania concerning Civil Appeal No. 47 of 2022, where the appellant, Total Tanzania Limited, challenged the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (TRAT), which upheld the imposition of the Railway Development Levy (RDL) by the Commissioner General of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) on JET A1 aviation fuel declared for home consumption but sold to international airlines.
