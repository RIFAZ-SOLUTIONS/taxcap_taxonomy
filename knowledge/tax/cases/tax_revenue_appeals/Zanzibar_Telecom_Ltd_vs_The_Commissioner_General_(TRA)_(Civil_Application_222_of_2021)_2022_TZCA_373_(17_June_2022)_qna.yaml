Resisting the application, the respondent has filed two affidavits in reply noting most of the averments in the founding affidavits but disputing just a few of them.

  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. For a start, although it may not be entirely necessary, I propose to highlight the rationale behind service of notice of appeal on the respondent provided by rule 84 (1) of the Rules; a replica of rule 77 (1) of the revoked Court of Appeal Rules, 1979. The rationale has been underscored by the Court in its decisions and stated to ensure that the respondent is made aware of the intended appeal against him. See the Court's decisions in Kantibhai 2ps. M. Patel v. Dahyabhai F. Mistry [2003] T.L.R. 437, Francis Itengeja v. Kampuni ya Kusindika Mafuta Ltd [1997] T.L.R. 148 cited in John Nyakimwi v. The Registered Trustees of Catholic Diocese of Musoma, Civil Application No. 85/08 of 2017 (unreported). See also: Boniphace Anyisile Mwabukusi v. Atupele Fredy Mwakibete &amp; Others, Civil Appeal No. 46 of 2021 (unreported). 2ps. 1ps. It has been held that failure to serve a copy of notice of appeal timeously or at all is fatal omission to the appeal for it amounts to failure to take one of the essential steps in the appeal warranting an order striking out the notice of appeal under rule 89 (2) of the Rules. See also: Boniphace Anyisile Mwabukusi v. Atupele Fredy Mwakibete &amp; Others, Civil Appeal No. 46 of 2021 (unreported). This would explain why the applicant had 2ps. to seek the Court's indulgence through this application even though she had served the respondent with a record and memorandum of appeal within a period of slightly above two months from the date of the impugned decision. I need not be detained on what it takes for the Court to exercise its discretion, for the law is so settled that one need not cite any authority in that regard. I will only cite Lyamuya 3ps.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of serving a notice of appeal on the respondent as per rule 84 (1) of the Rules?
        answer: |
          The purpose is to ensure that the respondent is made aware of the intended appeal against them, as emphasized in court decisions such as Kantibhai M. Patel v. Dahyabhai F. Mistry [2003] T.L.R. 437 and others.
      - question: |
          What is the consequence of failing to serve a notice of appeal on the respondent?
        answer: |
          Failure to serve a notice of appeal timeously or at all is considered a fatal omission, as it constitutes a failure to take an essential step in the appeal process, warranting the striking out of the notice of appeal under rule 89 (2) of the Rules.
      - question: |
          Can you name a recent case that highlighted the criticality of serving a notice of appeal?
        answer: |
          Yes, the case of Boniphace Anyisile Mwabukusi v. Atupele Fredy Mwakibete & Others, Civil Appeal No. 46 of 2021 (unreported), emphasized the importance of serving a notice of appeal and its consequences if omitted.
      - question: |
          What action did the applicant take after realizing the omission related to the notice of appeal?
        answer: |
          The applicant sought the Court's indulgence through an application, even though a record and memorandum of appeal had already been served on the respondent slightly over two months from the date of the impugned decision.
      - question: |
          Is it necessary to cite authorities when seeking the Court's discretion in such matters?
        answer: |
          No, the law on the Court's discretion is well-settled, and authorities need not be cited, although one example, Lyamuya, was mentioned in this context.
  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. This is more so considering that the applicant's advocates are based in Dar es Salaam and hence the instruction to Salum Ali Mussa, a Principal Officer and presumably a layperson to lodge which it which he did but failed to serve a copy on the respondent on a mistaken understanding that the service would be done by 2ps. the Tribunal staff. Next for my consideration is the length of the delay. That may be so depending on the peculiar circumstances. However, Mindful of the rationale behind service of a notice of appeal on the respondent can it be said that the delay in this application is inordinate? As indicated earlier, the respondent has noted most of the averments in the founding affidavits including the fact 3ps. that the applicant's advocate based in Dar es Salaam, discovered the want of service late in April, 2021 at the time of compiling a record of appeal. 2ps. 1ps. That may be so depending on the peculiar circumstances. However, Mindful of the rationale behind service of a notice of appeal on the respondent can it be said that the delay in this application is inordinate? As indicated earlier, the respondent has noted most of the averments in the founding affidavits including the fact that the applicant's advocate based in Dar es Salaam, discovered the want of service 2ps. late in April, 2021 at the time of compiling a record of appeal. In my view, mindful of the rationale behind service of notice of appeal, there can be no doubt that the respondent became aware of the existence of the appeal as opposed to an intended appeal on 06/05/2021 upon being served with a record and memorandum of appeal. By that time, it was 3ps.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Who was tasked with lodging the notice of appeal, and why is this significant?
        answer: |
          Salum Ali Mussa, a Principal Officer and presumably a layperson, was tasked with lodging the notice of appeal. This is significant because his mistaken understanding about service procedures led to a failure to serve a copy on the respondent.
      - question: |
          What rationale is highlighted behind the service of a notice of appeal on the respondent?
        answer: |
          The rationale behind service of a notice of appeal on the respondent is to ensure that the respondent is informed of the existence of the appeal, distinguishing it from merely an intended appeal.
      - question: |
          When did the applicant's advocate discover the lack of service on the respondent, and what were they doing at the time?
        answer: |
          The applicant's advocate discovered the lack of service on the respondent late in April 2021 while compiling the record of appeal.
      - question: |
          When did the respondent become aware of the existence of the appeal, and how?
        answer: |
          The respondent became aware of the existence of the appeal on May 6, 2021, upon receiving the record and memorandum of appeal.
      - question: |
          What key factor might determine whether the delay in this application is considered inordinate?
        answer: |
          The determination of whether the delay is inordinate depends on the peculiar circumstances of the case, particularly the mistaken expectation that tribunal staff would handle service of the notice.
