Resisting the application, the respondent has filed two affidavits in reply noting most of the averments in the founding affidavits but disputing just a few of them. In particular, the respondent avers that the misunderstanding of the instructions to serve a copy of notice of appeal 2ps. notwithstanding, the applicant had an obligation to serve it within the prescribed period and since this was not done, the applicant was bound to explain away the delay.

      1ps. 1ps. For a start, although it may not be entirely necessary, I propose to highlight the rationale behind service of notice of appeal on the respondent provided by rule 84 (1) of the Rules; a replica of rule 77 (1) of the revoked Court of Appeal Rules, 1979. The rationale has been underscored by the Court in its decisions and stated to ensure that the respondent is made aware of the intended appeal against him. See the Court's decisions in Kantibhai 2ps. M. Patel v. Dahyabhai F. Mistry [2003] T.L.R. 437, Francis Itengeja v. Kampuni ya Kusindika Mafuta Ltd [1997] T.L.R. 148 cited in John Nyakimwi v. The Registered Trustees of Catholic Diocese of Musoma, Civil Application No. 85/08 of 2017 (unreported). See also: Boniphace Anyisile Mwabukusi v. Atupele Fredy Mwakibete &amp; Others, Civil Appeal No. 46 of 2021 (unreported). 2ps. 1ps. It has been held that failure to serve a copy of notice of appeal timeously or at all is fatal omission to the appeal for it amounts to failure to take one of the essential steps in the appeal warranting an order striking out the notice of appeal under rule 89 (2) of the Rules. See also: Boniphace Anyisile Mwabukusi v. Atupele Fredy Mwakibete &amp; Others, Civil Appeal No. 46 of 2021 (unreported). This would explain why the applicant had 2ps. to seek the Court's indulgence through this application even though she had served the respondent with a record and memorandum of appeal within a period of slightly above two months from the date of the impugned decision. I need not be detained on what it takes for the Court to exercise its discretion, for the law is so settled that one need not cite any authority in that regard. I will only cite Lyamuya 3ps.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the rationale behind the service of a notice of appeal on the respondent as provided by rule 84(1)?
        answer: |
          The rationale is to ensure that the respondent is made aware of the intended appeal against them, as underscored by the Court in various decisions.
      - question: |
          What are the consequences of failing to serve a notice of appeal timely or at all?
        answer: |
          Failure to serve a notice of appeal timely or at all is considered a fatal omission, as it amounts to failing to take an essential step in the appeal process, warranting the striking out of the notice of appeal under rule 89(2).
      - question: |
          Which past case decisions were cited to highlight the importance of serving a notice of appeal on the respondent?
        answer: |
          The cases cited include Kantibhai M. Patel v. Dahyabhai F. Mistry [2003] T.L.R. 437, Francis Itengeja v. Kampuni ya Kusindika Mafuta Ltd [1997] T.L.R. 148, and John Nyakimwi v. The Registered Trustees of Catholic Diocese of Musoma, Civil Application No. 85/08 of 2017 (unreported).
      - question: |
          What step did the applicant take due to failing to serve a notice of appeal within the required time frame?
        answer: |
          The applicant sought the Court's indulgence through an application, even though a record and memorandum of appeal were served on the respondent slightly over two months after the decision.
      - question: |
          What legal principle governs the Court's exercise of discretion in such cases?
        answer: |
          The law is well-settled, requiring no authority to be cited, although the cited case is Lyamuya for reference.
  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. This is more so considering that the applicant's advocates are based in Dar es Salaam and hence the instruction to Salum Ali Mussa, a Principal Officer and presumably a layperson to lodge which it which he did but failed to serve a copy on the respondent on a mistaken understanding that the service would be done by 2ps. the Tribunal staff. Next for my consideration is the length of the delay. That may be so depending on the peculiar circumstances. However, Mindful of the rationale behind service of a notice of appeal on the respondent can it be said that the delay in this application is inordinate? As indicated earlier, the respondent has noted most of the averments in the founding affidavits including the fact 3ps. that the applicant's advocate based in Dar es Salaam, discovered the want of service late in April, 2021 at the time of compiling a record of appeal. 2ps. 1ps. That may be so depending on the peculiar circumstances. However, Mindful of the rationale behind service of a notice of appeal on the respondent can it be said that the delay in this application is inordinate? As indicated earlier, the respondent has noted most of the averments in the founding affidavits including the fact that the applicant's advocate based in Dar es Salaam, discovered the want of service 2ps. late in April, 2021 at the time of compiling a record of appeal. In my view, mindful of the rationale behind service of notice of appeal, there can be no doubt that the respondent became aware of the existence of the appeal as opposed to an intended appeal on 06/05/2021 upon being served with a record and memorandum of appeal. By that time, it was 3ps.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Who was responsible for lodging the notice of appeal, and why was there a failure in service to the respondent?
        answer: |
          Salum Ali Mussa, a Principal Officer, was tasked with lodging the notice of appeal. The failure occurred because he mistakenly believed that the Tribunal staff would handle the service on the respondent.
      - question: |
          What was the length of the delay in serving the notice of appeal to the respondent?
        answer: |
          The exact length of the delay is not specified, but it was discovered late in April 2021 when the applicant's advocate in Dar es Salaam was compiling a record of appeal. The respondent was officially served on 06/05/2021.
      - question: |
          What rationale was highlighted as important for serving a notice of appeal on the respondent?
        answer: |
          The rationale behind serving a notice of appeal is to ensure that the respondent is aware of the existence of the appeal and not just an intended appeal. This is crucial for procedural fairness.
      - question: |
          When did the respondent officially become aware of the appeal, and how?
        answer: |
          The respondent officially became aware of the appeal on 06/05/2021 when they were served with the record and memorandum of appeal.
      - question: |
          What factor contributed to the applicant's delay in discovering the failure to serve the notice of appeal?
