  **Document Outline:**
  This document summarizes the proceedings of a civil appeal in the Court of Appeal of Tanzania involving Star Media (Tanzania) Limited (Appellant) and the Tanzania Revenue Authority (Respondent). The case arises from the dismissal by the Tax Appeals Board of the appellant's application for an extension of time to lodge a notice of appeal against a tax assessment, which included a demand for over TZS 8.4 billion, and subsequent failed appeals at the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal and now the Court of Appeal. The central issues revolve around procedural compliance, the appellant's justification for delay, and the alleged illegality in the objection determination process.
