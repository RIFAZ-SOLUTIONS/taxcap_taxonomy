  - context: |
      1ps. 1ps. The respondent's counsel argued that this point was not raised before the Board for it to determine. Citing section 16 (4) of the Act, he argued that the Tribunal could not have decided on a point that was not decided upon by the Board. We find the appellant's argument that he became aware of the rejection on 18th 2ps. December, 2017 to be self-defeating, because before the Board, the affidavit taken in support of the application only cited the illness of 8th December 2017 as the reason for the delay. We need not remind the appellant that affidavits, which are statements made on oath, are the basis upon which applications are decided. Any statement not raised in affidavit is always disregarded as a 3ps. mere statement from the bar. 2ps. 1ps.

        answer: |
          The respondent's counsel argued that the point had not been raised before the Board for it to determine, and therefore, under section 16 (4) of the Act, the Tribunal could not decide on a matter not addressed by the Board.

        answer: |
          The claim was considered self-defeating because, before the Board, the only reason stated in the affidavit for the delay was an illness on 8th December 2017, and new claims outside the affidavit are disregarded.

        answer: |
          Affidavits, being statements made under oath, form the basis upon which applications are decided, and any point not included in an affidavit is treated as a mere statement from the bar.

          The precedent cited was Richard Mchau v. Shabir F. Abdulhussein Civil Application No. 87 of 2008, which emphasized that issues not raised in affidavits cannot be considered.

      1ps. 1ps. He too did not have an additional oral address. As we intimated earlier, the same issue is being presented for our determination again. First, in order to put matters in their proper perspectives, we ask whether the Tribunal really stated what is being alleged in the first ground of appeal that '! sickness could hardly be a cause for his delay... "\N\Xh respect, the learned Vice Chairperson of the Tribunal did 2ps. not say anything of that sort. Rather the Board, having found that by the time the appellant fell ill he was already out of time, it observed that:-"... the applicant's sickness o f 8th December, 2017 could hardly be a cause for his delay. It is to be noted that section 16 (5) of the Act is clear that extension of time may be granted on ground of 3ps. illness, therefore the Board would not have stated what it is alleged in ground 1 above. 2ps. 1ps. sickness could hardly be a cause for his delay... "\N\Xh respect, the learned Vice Chairperson of the Tribunal did not say anything of that sort. Rather the Board, having found that by the time the appellant fell ill he was already out of time, it observed that:-"... the applicant's sickness o f 8th December, 2017 could hardly be a cause for his delay. However, we cannot fault the findings of the Board and 2ps. that of the Tribunal that the alleged illness of 8th December, 2017 was irrelevant in accounting for the delay counted from 31s t August, 2017 because we agree with their finding that long before the appellant was taken ill, he was time barred in appealing. For that reason, the first ground of appeal has no merit and must be dismissed.

      - question: |
          What is the main issue presented for determination in the context?

      - question: |
          What was the finding of the Board regarding the appellant's sickness on 8th December, 2017?

          Why did the Tribunal dismiss the relevance of the appellant's illness in accounting for his delay?
        answer: |

         right to be heard. 
      
      With respect, we do not go along with the appellant on
         this point.   In Golden  Globe  International  Services  Ltd  &amp;  Another

  **Document Outline:**  
  The document is a judgment from the Court of Appeal of Tanzania concerning a civil appeal (No. 283 of 2021) filed by Ahmed Teja against the Commissioner General of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA). The appeal challenges the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal's decision to uphold the dismissal of an extension of time application by the Tax Appeals Board, primarily focusing on whether the lower bodies erred in their findings that the appellant's illness could not justify his delay in filing an objection to the respondent's tax assessments.
