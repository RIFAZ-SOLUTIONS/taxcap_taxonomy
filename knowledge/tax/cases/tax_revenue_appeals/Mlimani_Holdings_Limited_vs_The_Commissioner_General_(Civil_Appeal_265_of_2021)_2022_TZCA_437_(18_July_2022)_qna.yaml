We shall be excused for our inability to make reference to each of them in the determination of this appeal not as a result of lack of courtesy to them, but due to the dictates of the issue involved in this appeal. Essentially, the appellant's submission faults the Tribunal's approach in the interpretation of the DTA which is said to be erroneous. The learned advocate contended that a proper interpretation of the 2ps. DTA should have followed the approach taken in other jurisdictions which have interpreted similar double taxation agreements. A great deal of the history of the double taxation agreements and development in their interpretation occupied a significant space in the submissions of the learned advocate.

      1ps. 1ps. Eventually, the respondent issued three withholding tax certificates demanding a total sum of TZS. 346,492,916.00 for the period 2013 to 2016. Following an unsuccessful objection against the demand, the appellant appealed to the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board). The respondent's stance was that the DTA had no avail to the appellant in so far as the service fees paid to a foreign consultant was outside the scope of Article 7 of the DTA because it did not 2ps. form part of its business profits and thus liable to withholding tax in Tanzania. In its decision, the Board sustained the respondent's position. It held that the service fees were not embraced in the definition of business profits of the payee in the carrying of its business neither did it fall under any of the categories of the specific articles in the DTA. 2ps. 1ps.

      1ps. 1ps. The Court took a different view. It endorsed the Tribunal's decision which had held that the service fees were outside the scope of Article 7 (1) rather, Article 20 of the DTA. Few months later, a similar issue involving a dispute on the liability to withholding tax by another South African entity which had rendered services to a Tanzanian entity, arose in Mantra (Tanzania) Limited (supra). The Court reaffirmed its position 2ps. in Kilombero and dismissed Mantra's argument for being untenable. We heard Mr. Ngowi arguing with deep conviction that Kilombero was decided without the benefit of arguments based on OECD Model Tax Convention Commentaries hence taking a narrow interpretation of the DTA.

The Court felt unmoved to interpret the DTA 3ps. in line with the learned counsel for the appellant in that appeal.

      1ps. 1ps. Mr. Ngowi could not mince words responding to the Court's question on the correctness of the approach he was championing in the light of the decision in Kilombero Sugar Company Limited v. Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 218 of 2019 (unreported). He was unrelenting in his oral address that the decision was erroneous. Justifying his standpoint, the learned advocate contended that the 2ps. Court's attention was not drawn to the OECD commentaries on the relevant Articles from the OECD Model Tax Convention from which the DTA traces its route as a result of which the Court gave a narrow view in interpreting the DTA. By reason of such approach, Mr. Ngowi argued, the Court erroneously concluded that the service fees paid to the foreign consultant fell under Article 20 of the DTA 3ps. subjecting it to withholding tax.
